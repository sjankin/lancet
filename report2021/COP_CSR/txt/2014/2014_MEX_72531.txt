On 24 February 2014, the MOD granted a new explosives permit for the Herradura mining unit, thereby allowing Penmont to resume the use of explosives at this mine. Normal mining operations at Herradura resumed in March 2014 as preparations had been made in 2H 2013 for the lifting of the suspension of explosives, with holes for blasting having been pre-drilled at the mine. Alberto Bailléres As part of the on-going dispute with the Ejido, various Non-executive Chairman claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties. Penmont will continue to evaluate these issues and the Company will make such updates as is necessary to the market in relation to this ongoing dispute in the same way it has during the course of 2013. The Company has no intention of reactivating explosives within the Ejido land affected by the ruling. Furthermore, given that Soledad is not currently economically viable as a stand-alone mine independent of Dipolos, the Company has also suspended operations at that site whilst legal proceedings continue. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 11 Strategic Report Strategy 13 A Conversation with our Chief Executive 14 Market Overview 18 Our Business Model 22 Strategy and KPIs 27 Managing our Risks 42 Performance 54 Review of Operations 55 Our Mines in Operation 58 Our Projects in Development 70 Mining methods, equipment and skilled Our Exploration Programme 72 personnel help maximise the potential Social and Sustainability Performance 76 of our mines Financial Review 92 12 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Strategy Strategy Performance We seek to create value for our stakeholders across precious metal cycles, focusing on high potential silver and gold projects that can be developed into low-cost, world-class mines.

Our ﬂagship Fresnillo mine – more What can we expect going forward? than 500 years old – remains a A: proﬁtable base on which to grow First, let me clarify that what we saw in 2013 was a combination of the natural decline of the ore grade in the deeper areas of the San Carlos vein, which we expected, combined with certain structural difﬁculties in developing new rich areas of the Santa Cruz and San Mateo veins. Thus, production was largely limited to lower ore grade stopes. We expect average ore grades in 2014 to remain at 281 gpt and then gradually decline over the next few years to the ore grade currently in reserves, 271 gpt. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 15 A Conversation with our Chief Executive continued Q: Do the legal issues the Company faced in 2013 have broader implications for the business?

The reduced tonnage of material processed at Penmont explains the increase in our overall water intensity measures. 2012 2013 Community Investment Contributions made to support the communities where we operate, develop projects or explore. Our contributions comprise cash, in-kind support and administration costs. Our efforts target ﬁve strategic levers: education, social welfare (public health, social interaction and sports), environmental awareness, community capacity building and infrastructure. 2013 results Revenue reductions required our operations to be more selective in their community investment decisions.

The Executive Management team and Board of Directors are regularly updated on progress. Each advanced exploration project and major capital development project has a risk register containing the identiﬁed and assessed risks speciﬁc to the project. In 2012, the Board approved the San Julián project with an investment of US$500 million; at the end of 2013, the progress was 16.1% vs. 16.7% planned. The expenses incurred and committed are on budget. The major risk factor speciﬁc to this project is to determine a sufﬁcient water supply for when the mine becomes operational. The Company continues to invest in geo-hydrological and geo-physical studies for water supply. In 2013, the Board approved the Saucito II project with an investment of US$235 million; at the end of December 2013, the progress was 40.6% in line with plan. The major risk factor speciﬁc to this project is to face an unexpected presence of water that could delay the development of the mining works. At the Centauro Deep project, our efforts continue to focus on identifying an adequate and proﬁtable mining system, thus we plan to continue exploration to conﬁrm the nature of the mineral and mechanical and hydrological characteristics. During 2013, we faced a particular setback with regards to the explosives permit, since resolved, thus the advance in the development works was severely impacted in the second half of the year. A new explosives permit was granted by the Ministry of Defence in early 2014, allowing for a resumption of exploration activity. The major risk driver at the Orisyvo project is metallurgical recovery.

Annual attributable Our operating trajectory changed in mid-year 2013 when the Ejido silver production El Bajío legal proceedings ultimately led to a suspension of mining and beneﬁciation activities at Soledad-Dipolos and temporarily 42.7 moz halted mining activity at Herradura, thereby impacting annual gold +4.3% production at our Penmont mines. Notwithstanding, silver production rose in the year; we advanced our strategic objectives of maximising capacity and increasing efﬁciency; maintained our position in the silver cost curve; completed construction of a new facility on plan; advanced the development and construction of two new mines; and increased our total resources through on-going exploration. A full review of our projects conﬁrmed their economic viability even under stressed metal prices; however, we adjusted our investment budget downward slightly and deferred some minor capex allocations in order to decrease expenditures across this capital-intensive phase of development in current market conditions. We remain conﬁdent that the size and proﬁle of our growth pipeline will enable us to meet 2018 production targets and deliver continued value to stakeholders beyond the current cycle. As our social and sustainability system matures, we have gained greater visibility into the effectiveness of our programmes, policies and practices, and where we must continue to adapt and advance.

Community relations We sponsored a local festival and continued our permanent Financial performance campaign of garbage collections. Adjusted revenue decreased 21.7% to US$250.7 million in 2013, reﬂecting lower sales volume in gold and the lower prices of gold and silver. Ciénega is the Group’s most polymetallic mine, as evidenced by the 41.3% contribution from silver, lead and zinc (2012: 36.9%). Productivity increased in the year due to optimisation of the Primary crushing milling process. Cost per tonne milled at Ciénega decreased at Ciénega 8.1% to US$70.8 reﬂecting the positive impact of the 11.6% increase in ore milled and other efﬁciencies achieved, such as optimised shotcreting, lower consumption of anchors, reduced unit consumption of electricity resulting from the optimised milling process, and reduction in diesel consumption due to shorter haulage distances from upper levels of the mine, as well as lower medical expenses. These beneﬁts were offset by an estimated cost inﬂation of 5.4%. Cash cost per gold ounce increased to US$37.7.

The vast amount of resources at the Saucito mine warranted an expansion into what is now known as Saucito II. The new mine is expected to produce an average of 8.4 moz silver and 35,000 oz gold per year when it reaches full capacity, whilst maintaining low and competitive cash cost, thus it is a key contributor to the Group’s long-term production and proﬁtability goals. Mineral resources at Saucito II are included in Saucito’s total estimates. The project comprises the construction of a beneﬁciation plant identical to the current one operating at Saucito, but with an additional circuit to produce pyrite concentrates, which will be processed to increase recovery rates of gold and silver. What we did in 2013 Construction of the Saucito II plant The project commenced in 1Q 2013; detailed engineering, orders for and assembly of critical equipment critical equipment, and permits were all secured faster than expected, and construction progressed well. This, combined with the synergies achieved from current infrastructure in the Fresnillo district and the expected proﬁtability of the new mine led to a review of the project’s timeline and the subsequent decision to bring forward its delivery from 2H 2015 to 4Q 2014. Resources in terms of tonnages slightly decreased as a result of lower prices and higher cut-off grades used in the calculation.

Construction of the landing strip to facilitate the ﬂy-in/ﬂy-out requirement of the mine was concluded in 2013 and construction of the workers’ encampment started. Core drilling in the year signiﬁcantly increased total resources due to detailed underground information and the use of lower cut-off grades using realistic mining costs. The 42,819 metres of drilling carried out in the year included strategically oriented holes to conﬁrm the geological models. Development drifts on both the disseminated and vein ore bodies have delivered higher than expected grades of silver and gold. Additional resources were discovered on the Mireya and Calera veins.

We have built an experienced exploration team, composed of 82 geologists working alongside 75 technicians and administrative staff, and employ 385 local community members at our project sites. We are focused on the discovery and potential acquisition of large, low-cost silver and gold ore bodies in Latin America, in regions with the greatest geological potential and mining tradition such as Mexico and Peru. What we did in 2013 An extensive exploration programme was completed in 2013, including Gold reserves fell by 14.5% to 4.7 moz, due mainly to the revised 376,317 metres of core and 168,141 metres of reverse circulation drilling calculation criteria, whilst silver reserves declined 4.3% to 477.2 moz, on 25 properties, following geological mapping and geochemical/ related both to the change in price as well as to development delays geophysical surveys. at Fresnillo that were only partially mitigated by increased reserves at Saucito.

Our behavioural change objective is also supported by the STOP (Stop, Think, Observe and Plan) programme, paying special attention to supervisors in an effort to engage them and develop better attitudes and behaviours. 82 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Strategy Performance Investment in safety Fatal injuries Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) US$ million To employees or contractors per 200,000 hours worked 5.95 2 0.02 4.57 5.95 2 11 6 2 0.07 0.02 2012 2013 2010 2011 2012 2013 2012 2013 Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) Accident Rate Lost Workday Rate The number of fatalities + lost-time The number of lost-time injuries + The number of accidents divided The number of days lost to accidents cases + restricted work cases + fatalities per 200,000 hours worked by the total number of employees divided by the total number of medical treatment cases per 200,000 and contractors employees and contractors hours worked 3.22 0.43 0.69 0.58 4.66 3.22 1.19 0.43 2.21 1.73 1.42 0.69 1.64 3.11 1.48 0.58 2012 2013 2012 2013 2010 2011 2012 2013 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) Q 2012 Q 2012 Q 2013 Q 2013 4.638 5.382 6.022 3.875 7.454 5.980 1.744 1.276 1.842 1.010 1.599 1.319 0.85 0.53 2.83 0.67 1.10 0.44 0.64 0.21 0.29 0.16 0.20 1.13 Fresnillo Saucito Cienaga Noche Buena Herradura Soledad-Diplos Fresnillo Saucito Cienaga Noche Buena Herradura Soledad-Diplos www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 83 Social and Sustainability Performance 4 Sustainability: Advance and Enhance the Sustainability of our Business Environment 1 2 3 4 Mining and processing precious metals, while essential to the global economy, consume water, disturb land and produce waste and greenhouse gases in the ordinary course of business.

These adverse factors were mitigated by the lower depreciation and proﬁt sharing, as well as favourable results from MXP/USD hedging. As a result, gross proﬁt decreased from US$1,364.6 million to US$767.4 million. Exploration expenses recorded in the income statement of US$207.8 million decreased by 11.0% compared to 2012. Total risk capital invested in exploration was US$233.3 million, a decrease of 26.8% compared to 2012 and below the revised budgeted ﬁgure of US$242.8 million. This decrease reﬂected our continued commitment to investing through cycles albeit with a more conservative approach. The Silverstream contract was another factor that negatively affected the Group’s proﬁt levels, with a US$54.0 million non-cash loss registered during the period (comprised of a non-cash loss of US$65.7 million related to the revaluation of the Silverstream and an US$11.7 million gain resulting from amortisation effects during the period); this compares to a US$117.7 million gain recorded in 2012. We engage in some hedging activities to mitigate the impact of risks related to variables that are beyond our control such as prices, exchange rates and interest rates. These include hedging of a portion of lead and zinc production as these are the Group’s by-products; Mexican peso-US dollar exchange rates, which affect our cost of sales; and other currencies, such as euros and Swedish krona related to the purchase of equipment. In addition, we entered into a rate lock agreement in November 2013 in connection with the debt issuance due to the extreme volatility and the upward trend of interest rates at that time. Detailed information about hedging activities and derivative positions is explained going forward in each component of the income statement it affects. All the above factors resulted in a 69.5% decrease in proﬁt for the year and a 67.6% decline in proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders of the Group, to US$240.4 million. The Group ended the year with a cash position of US$1,251.7 million.

The Audit Committee uses regular evaluation processes as a means of ensuring that the governance over the controls environment is appropriate. Following the external independent evaluation of the Committee in 2011, in 2012 the Company Secretary facilitated the evaluation of the Audit Committee following up on the responses to the comments raised in the external evaluation in 2011 through a facilitated informal discussion among the members of the Committee. As a result of that discussion, minor amendments to the terms of reference of the Committee were proposed to and approved by the Board in March 2013. The Company Secretary has also facilitated a brief review by the Committee of its performance during 2013 and, speciﬁcally reviewed whether the Committee’s revised terms of reference required any updating. The Committee concluded that the terms of reference remained appropriate and that it received appropriate information to enable it to fulﬁl its responsibilities thereunder. An independent review of the Committee’s effectiveness is planned for 2014. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 121 Corporate Governance Report continued Audit Committee Report Description of focus area Audit Committee action Mineral reserves and resources The determination of mineral reserves and resources requires signiﬁcant We also discussed with Mr Giles, head of exploration, and SRK, the estimate with regard to future characteristics of mineral ore.

As the global mining sector moves the shared experience of working into a new and more challenging phase, we continue with our strategy, which takes a long-term perspective and is together as one team…” borne out of many years of history and experience in the mining sector. Last year, I said that the Nominations Committee will continue to ensure that the Board provides the right leadership needs for the Company as it continues with its long-term growth strategy. In addition, I also noted that taking this perspective would mean that change will not always be rushed. That said, we have continued to develop the senior executive team within the Company through the appointment of Roberto Díaz as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer in October 2013. This appointment brings our senior executive team back up to full strength. As far as the Board itself is concerned, I take great satisfaction in seeing how the Board has beneﬁted from the shared experience of working together as one team – irrespective of whether they are independent or not – over the six years since the Company’s IPO in 2008. This shared experience builds on and enhances the individual skills, Mr Alberto Baillères background and perspectives that each Director brings to Chairman of the Nominations Committee the Board. Although we will inevitably need to ‘refresh’ the Board from time to time as we go forward, as indeed we have begun to do in 2014, I hope that we will not lose any of the beneﬁts of this long-term shared perspective as new Directors are appointed to the Board. During the year, we have considered our policy on Board diversity as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. Our policy is set out in the Nominations Committee Report below. The Nominations Committee and the Board totally support the principle of appointments – whether at Board-level or elsewhere in our organisation – being made on the basis of merit. Neither gender, ethnicity or age are considered to be barriers to progress in our Company but neither are they, alone, good reasons to appoint anyone to the Board before they are ready. For this reason, we have not set any measurable targets in our diversity policy. Our broader initiatives for creating opportunities to develop a more diverse workforce are set out in the Sustainability Performance Report on page 90. Yours faithfully Mr Alberto Baillères Chairman of the Nominations Committee 130 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Nominations Committee The Nominations Committee did not use open advertising or retain any external consultants when making new appointments to the Board during Membership the year as such assistance was considered unnecessary considering the The members of the Nominations Committee are Alberto Baillères Company’s contacts within Mexico.

Members of the Executive Committee can, nevertheless, earn up to a 50% bonus set against three broad criteria. The ﬁrst relates to annual production and ﬁnancial results, and proﬁts excluding the changes in relevant metal prices. The second criterion concerns successfully ﬁnding and proving economically attractive new reserves. This, we believe, is a good measure of success in creating longer term value. The third element relates to the individuals’ contributions to creating outcomes for all the stakeholders in the Company, with special emphasis at this time on health and safety issues. These may vary to take account of individuals’ areas of responsibility and with areas calling for special attention from time to time. Some aspects of these are not capable of statistical target-setting and where outcomes are determined by our Committee against broadly deﬁned objectives. Lord Cairns Chairman of the Remuneration Committee In 2013, we reviewed the new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s salary, taking account of his performance in post during his ﬁrst year and increased it by 14%.

Page 139 The share prices in companies like Fresnillo plc are in large part determined by changes in precious metal prices over which our executives have no control. Additionally in line with the wishes of many shareholders, who wish to take any hedging decisions unilaterally, the Company does not undertake signiﬁcant hedging positions. This underscores the reason why we do not use share price as a determinant of variable pay nor do we see value for the Company in entering other forms of deferred remuneration arrangements (such as long-term incentive share schemes). Additionally, we believe that the annual objectives that we set have both short-term and long-term impacts which also make separate share-based incentives for the longer term unnecessary. 132 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 vwww.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Remuneration Policy in Summary The Group’s Remuneration Policy seeks to ensure that the Company The annual bonus rewards the achievement of shortand long-term is able to attract, retain, and motivate its executives and senior ﬁnancial and strategic business targets and delivery of personal management.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 147, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 2013 Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications for our report. Opinion on financial statements In our opinion: – The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; – The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; – The Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and – The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Our assessment of risk of material misstatement We identified the following risks that have had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team: – Inaccuracies in the recognition of related party transactions, including inappropriate revenue recognition – Inappropriate valuation of the Silverstream contract – Inappropriate mineral reserves and resources estimation – Inaccuracies in the disclosures, provisions and asset values arising from litigation and land disputes – Inappropriate assessment of impairment of mining assets www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 149 Independent Auditor’s Report continued to the members of Fresnillo plc Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on the financial statements, would be changed or influenced. When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material for the financial statements as a whole. This materiality is a significant driver of our scoping of the audit. We calculated materiality at the planning stage of our audit and updated it based on actual full-year results which reflected the continued decline in precious metals prices and the disrupted operations at Minera Penmont as explained in the financial review. Our final determination of materiality was US$23.6 million, which is 5% of profit before tax and before the effects of the Silverstream revaluation. On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is that overall performance materiality for the Group should be 75% of final materiality, namely US$17.7 million. Our objective in adopting this approach was to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of US$1.2 million, as well as differences below that threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. An overview of the scope of our audit Our assessment of audit risk and our evaluation of materiality determined our audit strategy and scope. The factors that we considered in our assessment included the following: financial significance, specific risks, effectiveness of the control environment and monitoring activities, including entity-level controls and recent internal audit findings. Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, we selected eight components which represent the principal business units within the Group and account for 87% of the Group’s profit before tax and 96% of the Group’s net assets. Five of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the remaining three were subject to a partial audit where the extent of audit work was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s business operations at that component. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. For the remaining components, we performed other procedures to confirm that there was no residual risk of material misstatement in the Group financial statements. The Group’s significant operations are in Mexico. All of the components are audited by one local team under our direct supervision. We visited the local team during all stages of the audit, participated in discussions on fraud and error and reviewed key working papers including but not limited to the risk areas described above. The audit work at the eight components was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component, which were lower than Group materiality. Our response to the risks identified above was as follows: – We assessed management’s process for identifying and recording related party transactions. We read contracts and agreements with related parties to understand the nature of the transactions. Throughout the performance of our audit procedures, we remained alert for any related party transactions outside the normal course of business. We compared actual results against detailed expectations of income statement line items impacted by related party transactions to corroborate that these have not been manipulated through related party relationships. We performed revenue cut-off testing and evaluated the appropriateness of the application of provisional pricing at year end. We ensured that related party disclosures in the financial statements are consistent with the knowledge we gained through the performance of our audit procedures. – With the support from our valuation specialists, we evaluated the valuation model used by the Company to determine the fair value of the Silverstream contract. We challenged management’s estimations and judgement with regard to inputs and key assumptions to the model through a comparison to market data and an analysis of the consistency in use of assumptions within other areas of the business. – We assessed the professional competence, objectivity, and capabilities of the experts engaged by the Company to audit reserves and resources estimates. We ensured that the scope of the work undertaken by the experts was appropriate. We read the report of the external experts and gained an understanding of the changes in reserves and resources estimates in the year. We assessed the reasonableness of the estimation method applied by management to arrive at the price at which the ore cut-off grade is determined. We ensured that this price was not inconsistent with price assumptions applied in other areas of the business. We ensured that the reserves and resources estimates have been correctly applied to the relevant areas of the Group’s financial statements including depreciation, depletion and amortisation, impairment and going concern. – We evaluated management’s assessment of the litigation and claims and considered the requirement for any provision and related disclosures. We challenged management’s assessment of the likelihood that further economic benefits will flow from the use of the assets impacted by land disputes and of indicators of impairment in respect of those assets. Our procedures included obtaining independent legal confirmation letters from the Group’s external lawyers handling these issues, holding discussions with management and the Group’s internal lawyers, examining underlying discounted cash flow models and analysing pertinent correspondence between the involved parties. – We have examined the valuation models that underpin management’s assessment of impairment in respect of the Group’s mining assets. We ensured that the methodology used within the models was compliant with IFRS requirements. We challenged the inputs and key assumptions in the models through a comparison with external sources of market data and to other areas within the Group financial statements. 150 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion: – The part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and – The information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following: Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: – Materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements – Apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit is otherwise misleading. In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: – Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us – The parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns – Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made – We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: – The directors’ statement, on page 147, in relation to going concern – The part of the corporate governance report relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.

Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation and consolidation, and statement of compliance Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial instruments and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated. The comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been restated due to the retrospective application of certain accounting policies; refer to notes 2 (b) and 32. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as of 31 December 2013 and 2012, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended. Entities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. These interests primarily represent the interests in Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V., Minera El Bermejal, S. de R.L. de C.V., Minera Juanicipio, S.A. de C.V. and Exploraciones y Desarrollos Mineros Coneto, S.A. P. I. de C.V. not held by the Group. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance. (b) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective as of 1 January 2013. New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group The Group has applied, for the first time, certain standards, interpretations and amendments that require restatement of previous financial statements. These include amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and the new IFRIC 20 Stripping cost during the production phase of a surface mine. In addition, the adoption of the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement resulted in additional disclosures. The nature and the effect of these changes are disclosed below. – IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) – Amendments to IAS 1: The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in OCI. Items that could be reclassified or recycled to profit or loss at a future point in time are presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affected presentation only and had no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance. – IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 2011) (IAS 19R): IAS 19R includes a number of amendments to the accounting for defined benefit plans, including actuarial gains and losses that are now recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit and loss; expected returns on plan assets that are no longer recognised in profit or loss, instead, there is a requirement to recognise interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) in profit or loss, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation, and; unvested past service costs are now recognised in profit or loss at the earlier of when the amendment occurs or when the related restructuring or termination costs are recognised. Other amendments include new disclosures, such as, quantitative sensitivity disclosures. Refer to note 32 for details of the financial effect of adopting this interpretation. – IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted as well as a requirement for enhanced disclosures. Application of IFRS 13 has not impacted the fair value measurements of the Group. Additional disclosures where required, are provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were determined. Fair value hierarchy is provided in note 30. – IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine (New interpretation): IFRIC 20 now clarifies when an entity should recognise production phase waste removal (stripping) costs (production stripping costs) incurred in relation to a surface mining operation as an asset. Such an asset will be referred to as a stripping activity asset. The Group has adopted this new interpretation at 1 January 2013 with restatement of the comparative period of 2012. Refer to note 32 for details of the financial effect of adopting this interpretation. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 159 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: – Classification and Measurement: IFRS 9, as issued, reflects the first phase of the IASB’s work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard was initially effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, but Amendments to IFRS 9 Mandatory Effective Date of IFRS 9 and Transition Disclosures, issued in December 2011, moved the mandatory effective date to 1 January 2015. In November 2013, the Board amended the standard to remove the mandatory effective date. – Hedge accounting: In November 2013, the IASB completed amendments to hedge accounting, which bring into effect a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting that will allow entities to better reflect their risk management activities in the financial statements; allow the changes to address the so-called ‘own credit’ issue that were already included in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to be applied in isolation without the need to change any other accounting for financial instruments; and remove the 1 January 2015 mandatory effective date of IFRS 9, to provide sufficient time for preparers of financial statements to make the transition to the new requirements. – IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: The standard replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also includes the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, as adopted by the European Union. The Group does not expect this standard to have a significant impact on its financial position and performance. – IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities: IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were previously in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28. These disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities. A number of new disclosures will also be required. This standard will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 with the adoption of IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27 (2012) and IAS 28 (2012). The Group will include the relevant disclosures required by IFRS 12 upon adoption. The IASB and IFRIC have issued other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective. (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Judgements Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are: – Determination of functional currencies note 2(d): The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. – Evaluation of projects status note 2(e): The evaluation of project status impacts the accounting for costs incurred and requires management judgement. This includes the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals to justify the commencement of capitalisation of costs; the timing of the end of the exploration phase and the start of the development phase and the commencement of the production phase. These judgements directly impact the treatment of costs incurred and proceeds from the sale of metals from ore produced. – Stripping costs 2(e) The Group incurs waste removal costs (stripping costs) during the development and production phases of its surface mining operations. During the production phase, stripping costs (production stripping costs) can be incurred both in relation to the production of inventory in that period and the creation of improved access and mining flexibility in relation to ore to be mined in the future. The former are included as part of the costs of inventory, while the latter are capitalised as a stripping activity asset, where certain criteria are met. Significant judgement is required to distinguish between development stripping and production stripping and to distinguish between the production stripping that relates to the extraction of inventory and what relates to the creation of a stripping activity asset. 160 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Once the Group has identified its production stripping for each surface mining operation, it identifies the separate components of the ore bodies for each of its mining operations. An identifiable component is a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. Significant judgement is required to identify and define these components, and also to determine the expected tonnes of waste to be stripped and ore to be mined in each of these components. These assessments are undertaken for each individual mining operation based on the information available in the mine plan. The mine plans and, therefore, the identification of components, will vary between mines for a number of reasons. These include, but are not limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location and/or financial considerations. Judgement is also required to identify a suitable production measure to be used to allocate production stripping costs between inventory and any stripping activity asset(s) for each component. The Group considers that the ratio of the expected tonnes of waste to be stripped for the expected tonnes of ore to be mined for a specific component of the ore body, is the most suitable production measure. Furthermore, judgements and estimates are also used to apply the units of production method in determining the depreciable lives of the stripping activity asset(s). – Contingencies (note 26) By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. Estimates and assumptions Significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include: – Estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources, note 2(e): Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s mining properties. The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates, in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code 2012. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such as estimates of commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and production costs, along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body. As the economic assumptions used may change and as additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine, estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources may change. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported balance sheet and income statement including: – The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows, those cash flows consider both ore reserves and mineral resources; – Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using the units of production method, or where the useful life of the related assets change; units of production method considers ore reserves; – Capitalised stripping costs recognised in the income statement as either part of mine properties or as part of inventory or charged to profit or loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios; determination of stripping ratios is based on ore reserves; – Provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve estimates affect expectations about when such activities will occur and the associated cost of these activities; and – The recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes in the judgements regarding the existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets. – Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes, notes 2(e) and 12: Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the unit-of-production method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine specific assets. This results in a depreciation/amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the estimated remaining life of mine production. Each item’s life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is used. – Silverstream, note 14: The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires significant estimation by management. The derivative has a term of over 20 years and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the Sabinas mine, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. For further detail on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see note 29. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions, foreign exchange, inflation and the discount rate is included in note 31. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 161 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued – Estimation of the mine closure costs, notes 2(k) and 21: Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine closure cost as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine life and changes in discount rates. Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the balance sheet date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required. – Income tax, notes 2(q) and 10: Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. (d) Foreign currency translation The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the parent Company’s functional currency. The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined. For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars, as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement. (e) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. The cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset when not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated. The expected useful lives are as follows: Years Buildings 6 Plant and equipment 4 Mining properties and development costs 16 Other assets 3 An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised. Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale. 162 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Disposal of assets Gains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. Mining properties and development costs Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred. Purchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination. Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession. Mine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained pre-operative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost. The initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. Revenues from metals recovered from ore mined in the mine development phase, prior to commercial production, are credited to mining properties and development costs. Upon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit of production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate. Mining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any. Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. The cost of construction in progress is not depreciated. Subsequent expenditures All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced, is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred. Stripping costs In a surface mine operation, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies (stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost of development and construction of the mine (the stripping activity asset) and charged as depreciation or depletion to cost of sales, in the income statement, based on the mine’s units of production once commercial operations begin. Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. This activity is referred to as production stripping and commences at the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the surface mine. The removal of waste may occur following initial extraction of saleable material and during the production phase. This stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria is met: – It is probable that the future economic benefits (improved access to an ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group – The Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved – The costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably Stripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as mining properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as ‘component stripping ratio’, which is revised annually in accordance with the mine plan. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset, by using the units of production method. The identification of components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated annually. Depreciation is recognised as cost of sales in the income statement. The capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletion/depreciation, less impairment in value, if any. Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from the cost of the stripping activity asset. If not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they are incurred. In identifying components of the ore body, the Group works closely with the mining operations personnel for each mining operation to analyse each of the mine plans. Generally, a component will be a subset of the total ore body and a mine may have several components that are identified based on the mine plan. The mine plans and therefore the identification of components can vary between mines for a number of reasons including but not limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location and/or financial considerations. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 163 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued (f) Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level. If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount of an asset The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group’s cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Reversal of impairment An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement. (g) Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; held to maturity investments; available-for-sale financial assets; or loans and receivables or derivatives designated as hedging instruments, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. Financial assets are offset with financial liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value, presented as finance costs or finance income in the income statement. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains or losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost. Loans and receivables from contractors are carried at amortised cost. 164 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Loans and borrowings After initial recognition at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss, in the income statement, when the liabilities are de-recognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. The Group shall adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense. This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. For more information refer to note 20. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held to maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is de-recognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. (h) Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are de-recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged, by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 165 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued (i) Inventories Finished goods and work-in-progress inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs. For this purpose, the costs of production include: – Personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore – The depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore – Related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). Operating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. (j) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. (k) Provisions Mine closure cost A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. (l) Employee benefits The Group operates the following plans: Defined benefit pension plan This funded plan is based on each employee’s earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on mxAAA (Standard & Poor’s) and AAA-mex (Fitch Ibca) credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss. Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the benefits have already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately. The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. Net interest cost is recognised in finance cost and return on plan assets (other than amounts reflected in net interest cost) is recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss. 166 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Defined contribution pension plan A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee’s salary. This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme. Seniority premium for voluntary separation This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary. The cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur. Other Benefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies. Termination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred. (m) Employee profit sharing In accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing (‘PTU’) equivalent to 10% of the taxable income of each fiscal year. PTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, paid in each fiscal year, is considered deductible for income tax purposes. (n) Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: a) There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement; b) A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term; c) There is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset; or d) There is a substantial change to the asset. Group as a lessee Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in the income statement. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Group as a lessor Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b) above. For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2007, in accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRIC 4. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 167 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued (o) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes. Sale of goods Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. The Group recognises revenue on a provisional basis at the time concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are delivered to the customer’s smelter or refinery, using the Group’s best estimate of contained metal. Revenue is subject to adjustment once the analysis of the product samples is completed, contract conditions have been fulfilled and final settlement terms are agreed. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined. In addition, sales of concentrates and precipitates throughout each calendar month, as well as doré bars that are delivered after the 20th day of each month, are ‘provisionally priced’ subject to a final adjustment based on the average price for the month following the delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Doré bars that are delivered in the first 20 days of each month are finally priced in the month of delivery. For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing, revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met using the provisional price. The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotation period ends. The selling price of the metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges. The revaluing of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue. The customer deducts treatment and refining charges before settlement. Therefore, the fair value of consideration received for the sale of goods is net of those charges. Other income Other income is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. (p) Exploration expenses Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions: – Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life – Exploration expenses: – Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves – Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identified by project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project 168 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (q) Taxation Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates. Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: – Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss – In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except: – Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss – In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Mining Rights The Special Mining Right is considered an income tax recognised in the income statement of the year. The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right that will be effective as from 1 January 2014. (Note 10) Sales tax Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except: – When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable; and – When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included. The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 169 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued (r) Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using the Garmar-Kohlhagen formula. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: Cash flow hedges For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income statement of the related period. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement. When hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. Changes in fair value of time value is recognised in the income statement in finance costs. Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives. (s) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 170 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (t) Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 31 and 32. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: – In the principal market for the asset or liability – In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 31. (u) Dividend distribution Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s shareholders or Board as appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s subsidiaries. 3. Segment reporting For management purposes the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines. At 31 December 2013 the Group has six reportable operating segments following the successful conclusion of the development of the Noche Buena mine in February 2012 and commercial production starting in March 2012. The following segments represent the Group’s six producing mines as follows: – The Fresnillo mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, the world’s largest primary silver mine – The Saucito mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine – The Ciénega mine, located in the State of Durango, an underground gold mine; including the San Ramon satellite mine – The Herradura mine, located in the State of Sonora, a surface gold mine – The Soledad-Dipolos mine, located in the State of Sonora, a surface gold mine – The Noche Buena mine, located in State of Sonora, a surface gold mine The operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group´s chief operating decisionmaker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 171 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The exploration services provided by the exploration companies listed in note 1 and projects under development have been aggregated into the Other segment below. Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in Revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within Cost of Sales and Gross Profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to Gross Profit as per the consolidated income statement. Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arm’s length basis similar to transactions with third parties. In 2013 and 2012 substantially all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico.

to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to the same fiscal authority. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to US$159.2 million (2012: US$67.9 million). The Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$5.6 million (2012: US$3.6 million) on which no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits. (d) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,271 million (2012: US$1,256 million). Corporate Income Tax (‘Impuesto Sobre la Renta’ or ‘ISR’), Special Mining Right (‘SMR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica’ or ‘IETU’) The Group’s principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes. In December 2013, a new Tax Reform was enacted, effective as from 1 January 2014. As a result of such Tax Reform, a new Income Tax Law (ISR) was enacted and the IETU Law was abolished. The new ISR includes: – new criteria and limits for certain tax deductions, that among others are; payroll-related expenses, including contributions to pension funds that are considered exempt income for employees will be considered non-deductible; – certain payments to related parties, that do not comply with specific legal requirements would be considered as non-deductible; – the requirement to calculate the mandatory profit sharing (PTU) that is paid to Mexican employees on the same base as the income tax, before deduction for profit sharing and before the use of net operating losses. Differences between the profit sharing and income tax base historically relate to inflation accounting, which is not included in profit sharing, the recognition of exchange gains and losses, and the recognition of income for dividends; and – a dividend withholding tax of 10% tax on distributions of dividends paid to Mexican individuals as well as foreign residents. Dividends between Mexican resident entities are not subject to tax at the shareholder level. The corporate income tax rate for 2013, under the new ISR, will remain at 30%. Previously enacted reductions of the tax rate over the next two years to 28% have been repealed. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been remeasured to reflect these changes, the remeasurement increased income tax expense by US$14.5 million. As part of the new Tax Reform, the Federal Rights Law was amended on certain mining matters with the new SMR added as from 1 January 2014. The SMR is considered as income tax under IFRS, and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions will be subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities. The 7.5% tax will apply to a base of income before interest, annual inflation adjustment, taxes paid on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR. This SMR can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year. Depreciation expense relating to property, plant and equipment will not be deductible for this SMR, consequently, the Group has recognised at 31 December 2013, a deferred tax liability of US$36.1 million in the income statement for the year. IETU was an alternative minimum corporate income tax, effective from 1 January 2008 through 31 December 2013. Companies were required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU which was calculated at the rate of 17.5% and applied to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions were allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income. Other mining rights In addition to the SMR, the following new mining rights were added to the Federal Right Law, as part of the Tax Reform, which will be effective 1 January 2014. These rights are not considered as an income tax. – Additional Mining Right which consists of a 50% increase in the duties per hectare for concessions not explored nor exploited during two continuous years during the first 11 years of obtaining the concession. Furthermore, there is a 100% increase in the right per hectare for concessions not being explored or exploited during a continuous two-year period starting on year 12 of the concession. This right is payable semi-annually in January and July of each year. – Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles, over its sales of gold, silver or platinum obtained during a fiscal year. The payment must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions. It is explicitly required that the taxpayers must maintain separate accounting to identify the specific sales of gold, silver and platinum. The compliance with this Extraordinary Mining Duty is independent from other mining rights. The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax. 180 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements 11.

This decrease has been consistent during the past 12-month period, which is considered to be prolonged; therefore, an impairment of US$2.1 million, of the US$64.2 million fair value change, was recognised as other expenses, in the income statement. The fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market. 182 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements 14. Silverstream contract On 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Peñoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Peñoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine (‘Sabinas’), a base metals mine owned and operated by the Peñoles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of $2.00 in years one to five and $5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment commencing on 31 December 2013) is payable to Peñoles. Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Peñoles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Peñoles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall. The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate. Changes in the contract’s fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2013 total proceeds received in cash were US$63.8 million (2012: US$110.6 million) of which, US$11.0 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2012 (2012: US$13.6 million). Cash received in respect of the year of US$52.8 million (2012: US$97.0 million) corresponds to 3.5 million ounces of payable silver (2012: 3.8 million ounces). As at 31 December 2013, a further US$8.1 million (2012: US$11 million) of cash corresponding to 560,465 ounces of silver is due (2012: 378,345 ounces). The most significant drivers of the US$54.0 million unrealised loss taken to income statement (2012: US$117.7 million gain) were the updating of assumptions utilised to value the Silverstream contract, most significantly the forward price of silver which was lower than expected given the cyclical nature of prices, the increase of the reference discount rate (LIBOR) and the difference between payments already received in 2013 and payments estimated in the valuation model as at 31 December 2012. These were partially offset by an increase in the Sabinas mine reserves and resources.

Provision for mine closure cost The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits. The present value of the provision at 31 December 2013 has been calculated using an annual real discount rate of 4.5% (2012: 4.5%). The unwinding of discount charge in 2013 has been calculated using a nominal discount rate of 7.00% (2012: 7.00%). Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning, dismantling, and reclamation alternatives and timing, the levels of discount foreign exchange and inflation rates. Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group’s intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the life of the mines. The provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine, based on the reserves and resources, which ranges from three to 30 years from 31 December 2013 (three to 38 years from 31 December 2012).

Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans The Group adopted revisions to IAS19 Employee Benefits (‘IAS 19R’) retrospectively in accordance with the transitional provisions set out in IAS 19R and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. IAS 19R introduces changes to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of post-employment benefits. Refer to note 32 ‘Effect of changes in accounting policies’ for more information. The Group has a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan. The defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each worker’s earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired through 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers. Pensions benefits accrued as at 1 July 2007, are restated based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) until the retirement date of each worker. The overall investment policy and strategy for the Group’s defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan. However, the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded. The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations. The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan, including potential short-term liquidity requirements. The defined benefit contribution plan was established as from 1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each non-unionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers’ contributions, capped at 8% of the employee’s annual salary. Death and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 187 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The following tables provide information relating to changes in the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets: Pension cost charge to income statement Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI Return on plan assets Actuarial Actuarial (excluding changes changes amounts arising from arising from Balance at Sub-total included changes in changes in Sub-total Balance at 1 January Service Net Foreign recognised Benefits in net demographic financial Experience Foreign included Contributions 31 December 2013 cost Interest exchange in the year paid interest) assumptions assumptions adjustments exchange in OCI by employer 2013 US$ thousands Defined benefit obligation (31,500) (951) (2,152) 276 (2,827) 1,113 – (467) – (320) – (787) – (34,001) Fair value on plan assets 20,777 – 1,439 (196) 1,243 (1,113) (968) – – – 30 (938) 2,557 22,526 Net benefit liability (10,723) (951) (713) 80 (1,584) – (968) (467) – (320) 30 (1,725) 2,557 (11,475) Pension cost charge to income statement Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI Return on plan assets Actuarial Actuarial (excluding changes changes amounts arising from arising from Balance at Sub-total included changes in changes in Sub-total Balance at 1 January Service Net Foreign recognised Benefits in net demographic financial Experience Foreign included Contributions 31 December 2012 cost Interest exchange in the year paid interest) assumptions assumptions adjustments exchange in OCI by employer 2012 US$ thousands Defined benefit obligation (38,150) (889) (3,124) (2,961) (6,974) 11,646 – – (1,994) 3,972 – 1,978 – (31,500) Fair value on plan assets 28,910 – 2,409 2,256 4,665 (11,646) (1,241) – – – 89 (1,152) – 20,777 Net benefit liability (9,240) (889) (715) (705) (2,309) – (1,241) – (1,994) 3,972 89 (826) – (10,723) Of the total defined benefit obligation, US$8.2 million (2012: US$7.4 million) relates to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers which are not funded.

These leases have renewal terms at the option of the lessee at lease payments based on market prices at the time of renewal. There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases. The Group has put in place several arrangements to finance mine equipment through loans and the sale of mine equipment to contractors. In both cases, contractors are obligated to use these assets in rendering services to the Group as part of the mining work contract, during the term of financing or credit, which ranges from two to six years. The Group considers that the related mining work contracts contain embedded operating leases. The future minimum rental commitments under these leases are as follows: As at 31 December 2013 2012 US$ thousands US$ thousands Within one year 11,742 10,425 After one year but not more than five years 4,161 9,624 15,903 20,049 As at 31 December 2013 2012 US$ thousands US$ thousands Minimum lease payments expensed in the year 9,765 8,157 26. Contingencies As of 31 December 2013, the Group has the following contingencies: – The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. – Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. – In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. – On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate. – Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax. 190 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements – On 30 November 2012, the Mexican government enacted a new federal labour law. Management is currently evaluating the new labour law for any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group, however management does not expect any significant effect on the Group’s financial statements as at 31 December 2013 and going forward. In 2009 five members of the El Bajio agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim with the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of Soledad-Dipolos is located. Minera Penmont’s mining concessions are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order pursuant to which the Magistrate of the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora, ordered Penmont to vacate 1,824 hectares of land in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. To date the disputed land has been returned by Penmont, with remediation activities pending in approximately 300 hectares. The Magistrate has noted that remediation activities are necessary to comply with relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) regarding the same. The execution of the court ruling also resulted in the temporary suspension by the Mexican Ministry of Defense (Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional or MOD) of the single explosives permit which covered the Dipolos pit as well as its adjacent Soledad pit and Herradura. The Soledad pit and Herradura are outside of the area affected by the court ruling, which was confirmed by a court-appointed topographer. The Company filed a request to lift the explosives suspension at the Soledad pit and Herradura. In connection with the foregoing matter, the El Bajio agrarian community entered cease and desist proceedings before a Federal district court in Sonora, requesting relief against the potential lifting of the suspension on the use of explosives and originally obtained a temporary stay order, which was subsequently not upheld by the district court. Following a hearing on 24 January, the district court denied the request by the Ejido El Bajío to prevent the lifting of the explosives permit covering Herradura and Soledad. The Company received no indication that the Ejido has filed an ultimate appeal regarding the foregoing and the time frame for filing such an appeal has expired. On 24 February 2014 the MOD granted a new explosives permit for the Herradura mining unit, thereby allowing the use of explosives at this mine. In connection with the foregoing matters, members of the El Bajío agrarian community have also presented additional claims, including a separate legal suit before the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora, claiming US$65 million for damages alleging that the Group improperly used the land affected by the court ruling, as well as cancellation of Penmont’s mining concessions and environmental permits within the El Bajío lands. Such concessions and permits are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land. The members have not yet presented substantial evidence to support their claim and the Group believes that these claims are without merit. Any initial ruling in this case would be subject to the appeals process in Mexico before judicial authorities other than the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora. Given the lack of evidence in support of the damages claim, the Company believes that an adverse and definitive ruling for the Group in respect of this law suit is not probable. Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties. There is significant uncertainty relating to the finalisation and ultimate result relating to these legal proceedings. 27.

A reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance for Level 3 financial instruments other than Silverstream (which is disclosed in note 14) is shown below: 2013 2012 US$ thousands US$ thousands Balance at 1 January: (6,136) (14,479) Changes in fair value (16,882) 4,262 Realised embedded derivatives during the year 21,864 4,081 Balance at 31 December (1,154) (6,136) The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts: The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Garmam-Kohlhagen formula, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency. Silverstream contract: The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model (for further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 14). This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peñoles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by Peñoles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 197 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above, and determines their impact on the total fair value. The significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. The fair value of the Silverstream is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future exchange rates, however, it is to a reasonable change in future silver price, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate is disclosed in note 31. Quoted investments: Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Interest-bearing loans: Fair value of the Group’s interest-bearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Loans with related parties: Fair value of the Group’s loan from related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates at each reporting date. Embedded derivatives within sales contracts: Sales of concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are ‘provisionally priced’ and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Group’s best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2 (o)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation. At 31 December 2013 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was US$(1.2) million (2012: US$(6.1) million). The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenues. (c) Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos and other currencies. The Group entered into a number of forward derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The outstanding forward derivative contracts as at 31 December 2013 are as follows: As at 31 December 2013 Contract value Contract 2013 Fair value Term Currency (thousands) exchange rate (US$ thousands) EUR1.31:US$1 to Euro denominated forward contracts 2014 EUR 3,248 EUR1.38:US$1 216 MX$12.58:US$1 to US dollar denominated forward contracts 2014 USD 8,000 MX$12.61:US$1 (317) The Group’s euro-denominated forward derivative instruments mature over a period from 12 March to 10 September 2014 at a weighted average rate of US$1.31: €1. The Group also entered into a number of US dollar denominated forward contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These derivative instruments mature on 13 January 2014 with a weighted average rate of MX$12.60: US$1. The Group also entered into Mexican peso-US dollar collars to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Collar derivative instruments mature over the period from 13 January 2014 to 15 December 2014. The collar instruments hedge costs denominated in Mexican peso amounting to US$221 million with a range of floor prices from MX$12.40 to MX$13.59:US$1 and a range of capped prices from MX$13.21 to MX$14.50:US$1. The fair value of the put options at 31 December 2013 was an asset of US$5.0 million, and the fair value of the call options at 31 December 2013 was a liability of US$3.7 million. Forward derivative contracts that were outstanding as at 31 December 2012 were as follows: As at 31 December 2012 Contract value Contract 2012 Fair value Term Currency (thousands) exchange rate (US$ thousands) Euro denominated forward contracts 2013 EUR 1,396 EUR1.28: US$1 58 Swedish krona denominated forward SEK6.49:US$1 to contracts 2013 SEK 54,708 SEK7.25:US$1 (237) The Group’s euro-denominated forward derivative instruments mature on 14 June 2013 at a rate of US$1.28: €1. The Group also entered into a number of SEK-US dollar forward contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These derivative instruments mature over the period from 15 March 2013 to 14 June 2013 with a weighted average rate of SEK6.78: US$1. The Group does not apply hedge accounting for SEK:USD forward contracts, therefore, changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the year. 198 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements The Group also entered into Mexican peso-US dollar collars to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Collar derivative instruments mature over the period from 7 January 2013 to 12 August 2013. The collar instruments hedge costs denominated in Mexican peso amounting to US$115 million with a range of floor prices from MX$12.75 to MX$13.78:US$1 and a range of capped prices from MX$13.57 to MX$16.16:US$1. The fair value of the put options at 31 December 2012 was an asset of US$2.3 million, and the fair value of the call options at 31 December 2012 was a liability of US$0.4 million.

Financial risk management Overview The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets, interestbearing loans and trade payables. The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: – Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks – Credit risk – Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. (a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Foreign currency risk The Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso, euro and Swedish krona which are exposed to foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, dividends, fixed assets, spare parts and other items. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 199 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued In order to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts with maturity dates from 2013 (see note 30 for additional details). The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.

These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles. The Group does not use derivative instruments to hedge against precious metals commodity price fluctuations. The table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in gold and silver prices, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in gold and silver prices is applied to all applicable periods.

Commodity price risk – Silverstream Future silver price is one of the inputs to the Silverstream valuation model. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Silverstream contract valuation to a reasonably possible change in future silver prices, with all other inputs to the Silverstream valuation model held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in silver price is applied to all applicable periods in the valuation model.

Interest-bearing loans and loans from related party are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related party are excluded from the table below. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, the Silverstream contract and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Group’s financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 27, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due, other than ‘Other receivables’ as disclosed in note 16. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. 202 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements The Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Peñoles, the Group’s primary customer throughout 2013 and 2012. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Peñoles group which currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating. The Group’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions. Accordingly on an ongoing basis the Group deposits cash and cash equivalents on a short-term basis with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 (Moody´s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor’s) and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days. As at 31 December 2013 the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 53% of cash and cash equivalents was deposited with one financial institution and 46% was held in short-term Mexican government paper. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 13 for the maximum credit exposure to available-for-sale financial assets, note 17 for cash and cash equivalents and note 27 for related party balances with Met-Mex. The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2013, being US$339.8 million (2012:US$487.8 million). (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows from operations and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Capital management The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing loans, including loans from related parties, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and availablefor-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders’ capital invested in the Group management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream. 32. Effect of changes in accounting policies a) Amendments to IAS 19R In the case of the Group, the transition to IAS 19R had an impact on the recognition of the actuarial gains and losses that are now recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit and loss. Such a change did not have an impact on the pension liability balance. Upon adoption of this amendment the Group reclassified actuarial gains and losses from cost of sales to OCI and net interest cost related to the pension liability of from cost of sales to finance cost, for the year ended 31 December 2012. The amendment did not have an impact on retained earnings. See details in table below. b) IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping cost in the production phase of a surface mine’ The IFRS Interpretations Committee issued IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine (IFRIC 20), effective 1 January 2013. Prior to the issuance of IFRIC 20, the accounting for production stripping costs had been based on general IFRS principles and the Framework, as IFRS had no specific guidance. Previously, the Group deferred production stripping costs for those operations where this was considered to be the most appropriate basis for matching the cost against the related economic benefits and the effect was material. This was generally the case where there were fluctuations in stripping ratios over the life of the mine. The amount of stripping costs deferred was based on the life of mine average strip ratio that was obtained by dividing the total tonnage of waste expected to be mined over the life of the mine by the quantity (e.g., tonnes) of economically recoverable reserves expected to be mined across the life of the mine expected to be contained in the economically recoverable reserves. Production stripping costs incurred in the period were deferred to the extent that the current period actual strip ratio exceeded the life of the mine average strip ratio. The amount capitalised was subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity, by using the units of production method. The life of mine ratio was based on economically recoverable reserves of the mine. IFRIC 20 now provides specific guidance on how to account for production stripping costs. It requires such costs to be capitalised where the recognition criteria set out in IFRIC 20 are met. IFRIC 20 differs from the life of mine average strip ratio approach in a number of ways – these include: – The level at which production stripping costs are to be assessed i.e., at a component level rather than a life of mine level; and – The way in which any stripping activity assets are to be depreciated. In addition, specific transitional rules are provided to deal with any opening deferred stripping balances an entity may have recognised under its previous accounting policy. Identification of stripping activity assets The first difference in the new guidance is the requirement to identify the components of each ore body. This will determine whether any stripping activity assets should be recognised and if so, the level at which such assets is initially recognised. IFRIC 20 defines a component as a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. An identified component of the ore body is considered to typically be a subset (‘phases of production’) of the total ore body of the mine. This suggests a lower unit of account than the entire life of mine, which is used in the current life of mine average strip ratio approach. It is considered that a mine may have several components, which are to be identified based on the mine plan. As well as providing a basis for measuring the costs reliably at recognition stage, the identification of components is necessary for the subsequent depreciation or amortisation of the stripping activity asset(s), which will take place as each identified component is mined. 204 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Depreciation of the stripping activity asset(s) The second difference in the new guidance relates to the way in which the stripping activity asset(s) are depreciated. Under the life of mine average strip ratio approach, the deferred stripping balance was released to profit or loss (or effectively depreciated) when the actual ratio fell below the average expected ratio. Under IFRIC 20, any stripping activity asset(s) will be depreciated or amortised over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body that is made more accessible by the activity, on a basis that best reflects the consumption of economic benefits. IFRIC 20 requires the units of production method to be applied unless another method is more appropriate. Refer to note 2 (e) for further information on the depreciation method applied by the Group. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRIC 20, this new policy has been applied prospectively from the start of the comparative period, being 1 January 2012. As a result of the adoption of the IAS 19R and IFRIC 20, the adjustments outlined below were made to the financial statements.

Company Financial Statements 1. Corporate information Fresnillo plc (‘the Company’) is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 6. The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes with tax residency in Mexico City. For further information see note 5. Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V. (‘Peñoles’) currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baillères family, whose beneficial interest is held through Peñoles. The country of incorporation of Peñoles is Mexico. Copies of Peñoles’ accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for the Fresnillo Group of companies. The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 3 March 2014. 2. Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which considers the realisation of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at 31 December 2013, the Company is in a net current liability position due to an increase in the intercompany loan. The Company’s Directors confirm that Fresnillo plc’s subsidiaries have funds and distributable earnings available for distribution sufficient to repay the intercompany loan and to fund other forecast liabilities of the Company to be incurred in the next 12 months. Further, given that the loan counterparty is a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that it will not request a repayment of the loan until such time as the Company has sufficient cash balances to make the repayment. As such the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements of the Company is deemed appropriate. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when otherwise indicated. The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated. (b) Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective as of 1 January 2013. New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group The Group has applied, for the first time, certain standards, interpretations and amendments that require restatement of previous financial statements, such as amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. In addition, the adoption of the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement resulted in additional disclosures. The nature and the effect of these changes are disclosed below. – IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) – Amendments to IAS 1: The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in OCI. Items that could be reclassified or recycled to profit or loss at a future point in time are presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affected presentation only and had no impact on the Company s financial position or performance. – IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted as well as a requirement for enhanced disclosures. Application of IFRS 13 has not impacted the fair value measurements of the Group. Additional disclosures where required, are provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were determined. Fair value hierarchy is provided in note 18. Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Company’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 211 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: – Classification and Measurement: IFRS 9, as issued, reflects the first phase of the IASB’s work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard was initially effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, but Amendments to IFRS 9 Mandatory Effective Date of IFRS 9 and Transition Disclosures, issued in December 2011, moved the mandatory effective date to 1 January 2015. In November 2013, the Board amended the standard to remove the mandatory effective date. – Hedge accounting: In November 2013, the IASB completed amendments to hedge accounting, which bring into effect a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting that will allow entities to better reflect their risk management activities in the financial statements; allow the changes to address the socalled ‘own credit’ issue that were already included in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to be applied in isolation without the need to change any other accounting for financial instruments; and remove the 1 January 2015 mandatory effective date of IFRS 9, to provide sufficient time for preparers of financial statements to make the transition to the new requirements. – IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (as revised in 2012): As a consequence of the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12, what remains of IAS 27 does not change the recognition and presentation requirements as it relates to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities, and associates in separate financial statements (cost method or fair value) and as a result the adoption of this revised standard is not expected to impact the parent Company financial statements. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with early adoption permitted. – IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: The standard replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also includes the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, as adopted by the European Union. The Company does not expect this standard to have a significant impact on its the financial position and performance. – IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities: IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were previously in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28. These disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities. A number of new disclosures will also be required. This standard will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 with the adoption of IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27 (2012) and IAS 28 (2012). The Company will include the relevant disclosures required by IFRS 12 upon adoption. The IASB and IFRIC have issued other amendments resulting from Improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective. (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimation is in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements. Judgements Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: – Determination of functional currency note 2(d): The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. Estimates and assumptions Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the consolidated financial information include: – Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets note 2(g) and 7: The Company classifies certain financial asset as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity. When the fair value declines, management makes assumptions about the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss. At 31 December 2013 impairment loss of US$2.1 million has been recognised relating to available-for-sale assets (2012: US$nil). – Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries notes 2(e) and 6: The Company assesses the investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. A value in use assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2013, impairment losses of US$628.0 million have been recognised relating to the subsidiaries (2012: US$nil). 212 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements – Contingencies (note 26) By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. (d) Foreign currency translation The Company’s financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined. (e) Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. When the Company incurs increases in or return of share capital, to/from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition or return of capital to the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. When this information is not available the fair value is determined based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount. Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. (f) Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. Financial assets are offset with liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value transactions through profit and loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments, as defined by IAS 39. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 213 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, net of directly attributable transaction costs, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss, in the income statement, when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. The Company shall adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense. This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans. For more information refer note 12. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is de-recognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. (g) Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are de-recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Company considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. (h) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. 214 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. (i) Share capital Ordinary Shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue. (j) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes. Trademark royalties Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received. Interest income Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established. (k) Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: – Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss – In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: – Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss – In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. (l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 215 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued In the Group’s consolidated financial statements these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges. Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives. (m) Fair value measurement The Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 18 and 19. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: – In the principal market for the asset or liability – In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 18. (n) Dividend distribution Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 3. Profit or loss attributable to the parent Company The loss for the Company is US$(292.2) million for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: profit of US$434.4 million).

The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,271 million (2012: US$1,256 million). Corporate Income Tax (‘Impuesto Sobre la Renta’ or ‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Única’ or ‘IETU’) The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes. In December 2013 a new Tax Reform was enacted, effective as from 1 January 2014. As a result of such Tax Reform, a new Income Tax Law (ISR) was enacted and the IETU Law was abolished. Among others, the new ISR includes: – Certain payments to related parties, that do not comply with specific legal requirements would be considered as non-deductible; and – A dividend withholding tax of 10% tax on distributions of dividends paid to Mexican individuals as well as foreign residents. Dividends between Mexican resident entities are not subject to tax at the shareholder level. The corporate income tax rate for 2013, under the new ISR, will remain at 30%. Previously enacted reductions of the tax rate over the next two years to 28% have been repealed. IETU was an alternative minimum corporate income tax, effective from 1 January 2008 through 31 December 2013. Companies were required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU which was calculated at the rate of 17.5% and applied to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions were allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 217 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 6. Investments in subsidiaries Year ended 31 December 2013 2012 US$ thousands US$ thousands Beginning balance 7,384,262 7,333,689 Impairment (604,627) – Additions 12,376 50,573 Ending balance 6,792,011 7,384,262 During 2013, due to the gold and silver prices decrease, the Company made an impairment assessment to determine whether the carrying value of each of its subsidiaries was impaired at 31 December 2013. As a result, an impairment loss of US$604.6 million was recognised with respect to certain of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries. Except for investment in Minera Mexicana La Ciénega, S.A. de C.V. (Ciénega), the recoverable amount was estimated based on the fair value less cost to disposal of each of the subsidiaries, which generally hold one operating mine or development project. Fair value less cost to disposal was based on the net present value of future cash flows related to each of the Company’s subsidiaries. In the case of Ciénega the recoverable amount was determined based on value in use. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 6.77%. Any further changes to gold and silver prices may result in changes to the value in use relating to Ciénega and would, therefore, result in further impairment or a reduction in the impairment. The subsidiaries in which investments are held as at 31 December 2013 and 2012 are as follows: Equity interest % Year ended 31 December Country of Legal company Principal activity incorporation 2013 2012 Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V.

This decrease has been consistent during the past 12-month period, which is considered to be prolonged; therefore, an impairment of US$2.1 million was recognised as other expenses, in the income statement, decreasing the carrying value of the financial asset at 31 December 2013. The fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market. 8.

Share issue cost paid amounted to US$0.3 million. The placing of shares ensured that Fresnillo plc is compliant with changes to the Ground Rules of the FTSE UK Index Series that require constituents to maintain a minimum free float of 25%. The proceeds of the placing were used for general corporate purposes and the Company’s working capital needs. As a result, the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital now consists of 736,893,589 (2012: 717,160,159) Ordinary Shares of US$0.50 each with voting rights. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company is 736,893,589. At 31 December 2013, all issued shares with a par value of $0.50 each are fully paid. The rights and obligations attaching to these shares are governed by law and the Company’s Articles of Association. Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transfer of the Ordinary Shares. The Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares only entitle the shareholder on winding up or on a return of capital to payment of the amount paid up after repayment to Ordinary Shareholders. The Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares do not entitle the holder to payment of any dividend, or to receive notice or to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. The Company may also at its option redeem the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares at a price of £1.00 or, as custodian, purchase or cancel the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares or require the holder to transfer the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares. Except at the option of the Company the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares are not transferrable. Reserves Share premium This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value. During 2013, share premium increased by US$335.4 million as a result of the issue of new Ordinary Shares on 3 May 2013. Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the difference between the value of the net assets acquired as part of the Pre-IPO reorganisation and the nominal value of the shares issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Movements in this reserve during 2013 represent the impairment of the carrying value of Fresnillo’s investments in subsidiaries transferred from retained earnings. Unrealised gains/(losses) on available-for-sale financial assets This reserve records fair value changes on available-for-sale investments, net of tax. On disposal or on impairment, the cumulative changes in fair value are recycled to the income statement. Retained earnings This reserve records the accumulated results of the Company, less any distributions and dividends paid. 220 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements 11.

Contingencies As of 31 December 2013 the Company has the following contingencies: – The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. – Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of the corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Company has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. – On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group (‘the Group’) and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate. – Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax. – On 30 November 2013, the Mexican government enacted a new federal labour law. Management is currently evaluating the new labour law for any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group, however management does not expect any significant effect on the Company’s financial statements as at 31 December 2013 and going forward. – In 2009 five members of the El Bajío agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim with the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of SoledadDipolos is located. Minera Penmont’s mining concessions are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order pursuant to which the Magistrate of the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora, ordered Penmont to vacate 1,824 hectares of land in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. To date the disputed land has been returned by Penmont, with remediation activities pending in approximately 300 hectares. The Magistrate has noted that remediation activities are necessary to comply with relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) regarding the same. The execution of the court ruling also resulted in the temporary suspension by the Mexican Ministry of Defense (Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional or MOD) of the single explosives permit which covered the Dipolos pit as well as its adjacent Soledad pit and Herradura. The Soledad pit and Herradura are outside of the area affected by the court ruling, which was confirmed by a court-appointed topographer. The Company filed a request to lift the explosives suspension at the Soledad pit and Herradura. In connection with the foregoing matter, the El Bajio agrarian community entered cease and desist proceedings before a Federal district court in Sonora, requesting relief against the potential lifting of the suspension on the use of explosives and originally obtained a temporary stay order, which was subsequently not upheld by the district court. Following a hearing on 24 January, the district court denied the request by the Ejido El Bajío to prevent the lifting of the explosives permit covering Herradura and Soledad. The Company received no indication that the Ejido has filed an ultimate appeal regarding the foregoing and the time frame for filing such an appeal has expired. On 24 February 2014 the MOD granted a new explosives permit for the Herradura mining unit, thereby allowing the use of explosives at this mine. In connection with the foregoing matters, members of the El Bajio agrarian community have also presented additional claims, including a separate legal suit before the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora, claiming US$65 million for damages alleging that the Group improperly used the land affected by the court ruling, as well as cancellation of Penmont’s mining concessions and environmental permits within the El Bajío lands. Such concessions and permits are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land. The members have not yet presented substantial evidence to support their claim and the Group believes that these claims are without merit. Any initial ruling in this case would be subject to the appeals process in Mexico before judicial authorities other than the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora. Given the lack of evidence in support of the damages claim, the Company believes that an adverse and definitive ruling for the Group in respect of this law suit is not probable. Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties. There is significant uncertainty relating to the finalisation and ultimate result relating to these legal proceedings. 222 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements 15.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Garmam-Kohlhagen formula, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency. Quoted investments: Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Interest-bearing loans Fair value of the Group’s interest-bearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 227 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued Loans with related parties Fair value of the Group’s loan from related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates at each reporting date. (c) Derivative financial instruments The Company enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its subsidiaries’ exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from the activities of these subsidiaries. In the Group’s consolidated financial statements these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges. The Company entered into a number of forward derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The outstanding forward derivative contracts as at 31 December 2013 are as follows: As at 31 December 2013 Contract value Contract 2013 Fair value Term Currency (thousands) exchange rate (US$ thousands) Euro denominated forward contracts 2014 EUR 3,248 EUR1.31:US$1 to 216 EUR1.38:US$1 US dollar denominated forward contracts 2014 USD 8,000 MX$12.58:US$1 to (317) MX$12.61:US$1 The Company’s euro-denominated forward derivative instruments mature over a period from 12 March to 10 September 2014 at a weighted average rate of US$1.31:€1.

These derivative instruments mature on 13 January 2014 with a weighted average rate of MX$12.60: US$1. The Company also entered into Mexican peso-US dollar collars to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Collar derivative instruments mature over the period from 13 January 2014 to 15 December 2014. The collar instruments hedge costs denominated in Mexican peso amounting to US$221 million with a range of floor prices from MX$12.40 to MX$13.59:US$1 and a range of capped prices from MX$13.21 to MX$14.50:US$1.

All gains and losses are taken to the Company income statement. 19. Financial risk management Overview The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets, loans to and from related parties, interest-bearing loans and trade payables. The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries. The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: – Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks – Credit risk – Liquidity risk. 228 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework. The Company’s risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. (a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Foreign currency risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, dividends and other items. As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings. Effect on profit before tax: Strengthening/ increase/(decrease) Year ended 31 December (weakening) of US dollar US$ thousands 2013 5% 7,370 (10%) (38,279) 2012 10% 22,861 (5%) (17,731) The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Swedish krona, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax, with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

The Company’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value, therefore, are excluded from the table below. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of available-for-sale assets to a reasonably possible change in market price of these equity instruments, reflecting the effect on the Company’s profit before tax and equity: Effect on equity: Increase/(decrease) Effect on profit before tax: increase/(decrease) Year ended 31 December in equity price increase/(decrease) US$ thousands 2013 70% – 45,368 (40)% (1,790) (68,945) 2012 30% – 38,233 (30%) – (38,233) (b) Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Company’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets and derivative financial instruments. The financial assets are trade and other receivables, intercompany loans, cash and cash equivalents and availablefor-sale financial assets. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties with what the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 15, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Company’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. The Company’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 (Moody’s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor’s) and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 7 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 9 for cash and cash equivalents and note 15 for related party balances. 230 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Capital management The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 231 Reserves and Resources Tables Fresnillo plc Consolidated Audited Mineral Resource Statement As at 31 December 2013 Quantity Grade Contained Metal Lead Zinc Tonnes Gold Silver Lead Zinc Gold Silver Tonnes Tonnes Resource Category 1 Cut-off Grade* (Mt) (gpt) (gpt) (%) (%) (Moz) (Moz) (000s) (000s) Fresnillo Underground Measured 9.66 0.78 657 0.83 1.41 0.24 203.94 79.70 136.39 83 gpt AgEq Indicated 26.27 0.80 307 1.95 3.68 0.68 259.18 511.47 965.31 Measured & Indicated 35.92 0.80 401 1.65 3.07 0.92 463.12 591.17 1,101.70 Inferred 33.56 0.71 312 1.24 2.56 0.77 337.04 415.32 859.74 Saucito Underground Measured 1.37 2.88 523 0.72 1.20 0.13 23.09 9.85 16.45 98 gpt AgEq Indicated 9.44 2.12 435 2.19 3.68 0.64 132.01 206.53 347.83 Measured & Indicated 10.81 2.22 446 2.00 3.37 0.77 155.10 216.38 364.28 Inferred 33.58 1.19 336 1.17 2.07 1.28 362.88 394.36 695.45 Ciénega Underground Measured 5.59 2.66 125 0.85 1.30 0.48 22.39 47.39 72.41 Various** Indicated 16.65 1.46 144 0.49 0.83 0.78 76.94 82.33 138.47 Measured & Indicated 22.24 1.76 139 0.58 0.95 1.26 99.33 129.72 210.89 Inferred 9.51 1.15 146 0.43 0.97 0.35 44.71 40.89 92.48 Minera Penmont Underground – Herradura Veins2 Measured Indicated 1.50 gpt AuEq 4.64 3.64 1 – – 0.54 0.15 – – Measured & Indicated 4.64 3.64 1 – – 0.54 0.15 – – Inferred 16.58 3.06 1 – – 1.63 0.53 – – Minera Penmont Open Pit2 3.19 Herradura (Disseminated) Measured 58.11 0.72 1 – – 1.35 1.87 – – 0.30 gpt AuEq Indicated 55.54 0.70 1 – – 1.25 1.79 – – Soledad & Dipolos Measured 16.60 0.64 1 – – 0.34 0.53 – – 0.30 gpt AuEq Indicated 7.80 0.58 1 – – 0.15 0.25 – – Noche Buena 3 Measured 18.19 0.56 1 – – 0.33 0.58 – – 0.30 gpt AuEq Indicated 23.21 0.52 1 – – 0.39 0.75 – – Herradura (Disseminated) Inferred 0.30 gpt AuEq 13.16 0.67 1 – – 0.28 0.42 – – Soledad & Dipolos Inferred 0.30 gpt AuEq 0.01 0.45 1 – – 0.00 0.00 – – Noche Buena3 Inferred 0.30 gpt AuEq 16.89 0.49 1 – – 0.27 0.54 – – Totals – Underground4 Measured & Indicated 73.62 1.48 303 1.27 2.28 3.49 717.70 937.27 1,676.86 Inferred 93.23 1.34 249 0.91 1.77 4.03 745.16 850.57 1,647.67 Totals – Open Pit5 Measured & Indicated 179.45 0.66 1 – – 3.80 5.77 – – Inferred 30.06 0.57 1 – – 0.55 0.97 – – 1 Mineral resources are reported inclusive of ore reserves.

All ﬁgures rounded to reﬂect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Metal assays were capped where appropriate. Mineral resources are reported at variable metal, metal equivalent, or NRS cut-off grades assuming reasonable metal recovery. Orisyvo, Lucerito, Candameña and Guachichil mineral resources are reported inside a conceptual pit shell based on appropriate mining and processing costs and metal recoveries for oxide and sulphide material. Equivalent metal grades are based on US$1,250 per ounce of gold, US$19.50 per ounce of silver, US$0.88 per pound of zinc and US$ 0.99 per pound of lead. 2 Portions of the Valdecañas deposit within the Minera Juanicipio property where Fresnillo plc holds a 56% interest. Mineral resources quoted reﬂect Fresnillo plc’s attributable 56% ownership. 3 Minera Parreña is carrying out exploration activities in these projects under option agreements with third parties. Minera Parreña has the right to purchase 100% of these projects. * Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries. ** Mineral resources statement prepared independently by SRK CA. 234 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2013 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Consolidated Audited Ore Reserve Statement1 As at 31 December 2013 Quantity Grade Contained Metal Gold Silver Tonnes Gold Silver Lead Zinc Ounces Ounces Lead Tonnes Zink Tonnes Deposit Cut-off Grade* (000s) (gpt) (gpt) (%) (%) (000s) (000s) (000s) (000s) Fresnillo Proven 125 gpt AgEq. 6.30 0.46 340 0.48 0.80 0.09 68.75 30.23 50.38 Probable 25.53 0.70 254 1.71 3.23 0.57 208.81 436.58 824.65 Proven and Probable 31.83 0.65 271 1.47 2.75 0.67 277.55 466.81 875.03 Saucito Proven 145 gpt AgEq 1.43 1.63 312 0.40 0.68 0.07 14.36 5.72 9.73 Probable 8.99 1.83 395 1.96 3.27 0.53 114.17 176.16 293.91 Proven and Probable 10.42 1.80 384 1.75 2.91 0.60 128.53 181.89 303.64 Ciénega Proved – Total Ciénega Multiple** 3.94 2.10 126 0.64 0.98 0.27 15.91 25.26 38.66 Probable – Total Ciénega 10.77 1.57 149 0.52 0.84 0.54 51.46 55.51 90.40 Proven and Probable – Total Ciénega 14.71 1.71 142 0.55 0.88 0.81 67.38 80.77 129.05 Minera Penmont2 Herradura (Disseminated) Proven Multiple** 32.24 0.80 1 – – 0.83 1.04 – – Probable 27.06 0.79 1 – – 0.69 0.87 – – Soledad & Dipolos Proven 0.30 gpt AuEq 13.93 0.67 1 – – 0.30 0.45 – – Probable 7.20 0.59 1 – – 0.14 0.23 – – Noche Buena3 Proven 0.30 gpt AuEq 16.10 0.56 1 – – 0.29 0.52 – – Probable 19.70 0.53 1 – – 0.34 0.63 – – Total Proven and Probable for Minera Penmonth Open Pit 116.23 0.69 1 – – 2.58 3.74 – – Totals – Underground4 Proven various 11.67 1.16 264 0.52 0.85 0.43 99.02 61.21 98.76 Probable 45.29 1.13 257 1.48 2.67 1.65 374.44 668.25 1,208.95 Proven and Probable 56.96 1.14 259 1.28 2.30 2.08 473.45 729.46 1,307.72 Totals – Open Pit5 Proven various 62.27 0.71 1 – – 1.42 2.00 – – Probable 53.96 0.67 1 – – 1.16 1.73 – – Proven and Probable 116.23 0.69 1 – – 2.58 3.74 – – 1 All ﬁgures rounded to reﬂect the relative accuracy of the estimates.
