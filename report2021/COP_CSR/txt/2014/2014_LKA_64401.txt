Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The Group buys and sells derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. All such transactions are carried out within predetermined guidelines. Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss. 3.1 Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies (Sri Lankan Rupee) of the Group, which are in general, US Dollar, Australian Dollar, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen. Effects of currency rate fluctuations of imported materials and ex-stock items are transferred in a reasonable manner keeping in line with the prices in the market. Subsidiary companies of the Group settle all import bills and other financial liabilities denominated in a currency other than functional currency, out of US Dollar receipts from their overseas customers.

Contd. Changes/adjustments made to conform to the requirements of SLFRS/LKAS (Note A) SLFRS 1 requires, at the first time adoption, to value the fully depreciated property, plant and equipment at the deemed cost. The fair value of each fully depreciated asset is considered as the deemed cost of each asset. The gain from this revaluation is credited in the Revaluation Reserves and subsequent depreciations are charged to the income statement according to the remaining life time of the each item of property, plant and equipment. (Note B) In accordance with LKAS 39, staff loans given at concessionary terms which were valued at historical cost under SLAS, were fair-valued using market interest rates. In accordance with LKAS 32, the adjustments arising therefrom have been recognised as prepaid staff cost and amortized over the tenor of the loan. The interest on loans is recognized using effective interest rate method and the staff loans are measured at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. In accordance with LKAS 39, impairment losses of trade receivable have been recognised only for incurred losses as of the reporting date. The impairment of trade receivables is carried out, in two categories which are as follows;  Individual Significant customers – Objective evidence of impairment /Incurred loss model  Individual Non Significant CustomersCollective Impairment (Note C) As per LKAS 39 other available-for-sale financial assets have to be initially and subsequently recognised at fair value. And accordingly, other available-for-sale financial assets, which have been valued at cost as per SLASs, have been fair-valued based on the present value of future free cash flows to the equity. Adjustments arising therefrom have been made in the other comprehensive income in accordance with LKAS 32.
