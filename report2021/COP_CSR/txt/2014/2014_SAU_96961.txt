Ban Ki-moon Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA Dear Mr. Secretary-General, I am pleased to inform you that SABIC is filing its second Communication on Progress (COP) since joining the United Nations Global Compact in 2012. The COP is integrated in SABIC's Sustainability Report for 2013, which is being uploaded to the UNGC website. We believe that our Sustainability Report reflects our continuing support for, and ongoing commitment to, the ten principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. We remain committed to those principles and to advancing those principles within our sphere of influence. We support public accountability and transparency, and we trust that our Sustainability Report demonstrates our progress. We look forward to showing further progress when we file our next COP in 2015. Mohamed H.
