Capacity growth continued to outstrip demand, with the exception of the last two months, leading to a continued, industry-wide decline in yields and load factors. However, not all markets were equally affected; we saw some positive developments in parts of our network, but, overall, conditions remained volatile. Fuel prices remained fairly stable, especially in the second half of the year, albeit on the high level observed since 2011. To mitigate these adverse trading conditions, Cargolux introduced additional capacity, contrary to the industry trend, and successfully increased volumes in order to maximize contribution to fixed costs. This helped us to reach a net consolidated profit of US$ 8.4 million for the year under review. Key performance indicators (including Cargolux Italia) Capacity, measured in ATK, increased by 20.7% vs. 2012, driven by higher block hours (+17.1%) in addition to the “Boeing 747-8 freighter effect” (134 tonnes capacity versus 113 tonnes for the Boeing 747-400 freighter). 2013 daily utilization (14:57) was down by 1.1% versus 2012 levels. The additional block hours were produced by the three Boeing 747-8 freighters delivered in 2013 (March, May & September), and an additional power-by-the-hour dry lease Boeing 747-ERF (LX-ECV) joining the fleet in November, while the Boeing 747-400 freighter LX-KCV was returned to its lessor in September. In addition, Cargolux continued to operate two Boeing 747-BCFs from Boeing on a power-by-the-hour basis. At the end of December, the fleet consisted of seven Boeing 747-400 freighters, nine Boeing 747-8 freighters, four power-by-the-hour aircraft (two Boeing 747-400 BCFs, one Boeing 747-400 freighter and one Boeing 747-400 ERF). The Company’s production, measured in FTK, increased by 19.2% vs. 2012. According to IATA statistics and measured by international scheduled FTKs, Cargolux’s global market share grew cargolux | Annual Report 2013 to 3.5% in December 2013. This positioned Cargolux as the number 8 airline in the IATA air cargo carriers ranking. Average system yield (USD/kg) decreased by 2.6% versus 2012. This includes fuel surcharge revenue, which was slightly below 2012 levels due to a lower average cost of jet fuel in 2013. The average underlying yield (excluding fuel surcharge) out of Area 2 (Europe and Central Asia) increased by 1.6%, due to a higher EUR/USD exchange rate (forex adjusted variation: -0.9%). Out of Area 4 (Africa), the average underlying yield dropped by 8.1% and that of Area 3 (Asia-Pacific) dropped by 3.3%. Area 1 (The Americas) suffered an average underlying yield decrease of 7.0%. These average yield reductions are either in line with, or slightly better than the average market yield reductions. Compared to 2012, tonnage sold increased to 753,848 (+16.7%) across the Cargolux network. Except Area 4 (Africa with +4.6%) and Charter (-4.0%), all areas had a double digit growth in tonnage (Area 1: +17.0%, Area 2: +17.9%, Area 3: +19.2%). 19 Financial review and analysis As at December 31, 2013 Markets and network including CV-Italia 2013 was yet another difficult year in the global airfreight market, arguably even more challenging than 2012. Even though demand for international scheduled air cargo (measured in FTK) grew by 1.2% vs. 2012, supply increased by 2.6%, further widening the existing supply/demand gap. Once again, capacity growth was largely driven by belly capacity in particular from combination carriers in the Middle East and Asia, who further grew their passenger fleets. The fact that some airlines grounded freighters during the year or went out of business altogether only provided a partial counterbalance to these capacity additions. On an industry level, the negative supply/demand gap had an adverse impact on load factors, daily utilization and underlying yields. The Company nevertheless managed to achieve significant FTK growth (+19.2% vs. 2012), far above global market growth. This was also possible due to the Company’s successful deployment of additional “flexible” capacity, i.e. aircraft operated on a power-by-thehour basis. Continued traffic flow volatility required a highly dynamic network planning and management. Apart from numerous short-term changes to optimize loads and production, the Company added an unprecedented total of twelve scheduled destinations worldwide, including Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile, Dallas, Columbus, Tripoli, Bamako, Port Harcourt, Ouagadougou, Muscat, Munich, Vienna and Zaragoza. Consolidation As in the prior year, the Company presents consolidated accounts in addition to Parent Company accounts. The consolidated accounts comprise Cargolux RE S.A., a captive reinsurance company, Cargolux Italia S.p.A., an Italian all-cargo airline and an Italian investment company, Italia Aerologistics S.R.L.. The Company’s equity accounts its participations in Champ Cargosystems S.A. (49%), 8F Leasing S.A. (33.3%) and a joint venture, Global Aviation Technical Solutions GB (BVI) Ltd (50%). Income statement Revenues increased by 13.4% from US$ 1,726.3 million to US$ 1,956.8 million. 33.7% of the revenues, or 659.9 US$ cargolux | Annual Report 2013 million, was accounted for by the fuel surcharge, up 12.7 % on 2012. On a yearly average, the Euro strengthened versus the US dollar (+3.3 %) which had a positive impact on the revenues. Other operating income increased to US$ 31.7 million from US$ 12.5 million in 2012, due mainly to compensations received from third party. Aircraft lease expenses increased by US$ 3.4 million or 11.8% to US$ 32.1 million despite lower lease expenses offset by less return condition releases. Aircraft maintenance expenses increased by 0.3% to US$ 95.2 million from US$ 94.8 million. The stability of the aircraft maintenance cost, despite an increase of hours flown of 17.1%, is due to higher utilization of Boeing 747-8 freighters, where engine cost per flight hours is lower. Other aircraft expenses mainly represented premiums paid to insure the Company’s fleet and increased by 6.3% to 20 US$ 6.7 million due mainly to the addition of nine Boeing 747-8 freighters over the past 26 months. Depreciation increased by 48.9% to US$ 123.1 million, due to the addition of three Boeing 747-8 freighters, delivered during the course of 2013 (LX-VCA, LX-VCH, LX-VCI). Fuel cost (including the result of fuel hedging) increased by 10.8% to US$ 919.1 million and represented 47.6% of total operating costs. US$ 10.3 million of premium spent on 2013 fuel hedges was not recovered. The marked-tomarket value of fuel hedging positions acquired to offset the Company’s exposure to higher fuel prices in 2014 and 2015 increased by US$ 0.6 million. Personnel costs and benefits increased by 3.7% to US$ 240.4 million. In Euro terms, the salary of all Luxembourgbased staff went up by 3.5% reflecting a headcount increase, a CWA time unit increase and a mandatory salary indexation which became effective in October 2013. Handling, landing and overflying costs increased by 18.1% to US$ 286.8 million in 2013. Handling charges went up by 19.7%. The impact of increased cycles flown (+16.5%) as well as additional tonnes handled (+16.7%) and a negative foreign exchange impact (EUR/USD: +1.8%) was slightly mitigated by a higher unit rate (0.8%). The landing charges increase of 21.2% was driven by increased cycles (+16.5%) and a negative foreign exchange impact (EUR/USD: +1.1%). The landing unit cost increased by 1.8%. Overflying costs increased by 13.2% mainly driven by a currency impact of 1.0% and additional block hours (+17.1%). Nevertheless, unit rates were reduced by 4.6%. Trucking, truck handling and interlining costs increased by 12.0% to US$ 111.3 million in 2013. Trucking and truck handling costs went up by 13.8%. This was due to a negative currency impact (EUR/USD +2.8%) higher tonnage carried (+16.7%), together with a lower unit rate (-3.5%) due mainly to network mix shift. Interlining costs went down by 2.0%, due mainly to a lower unit rate/mix change (-16.1%). Other operating expenses, including inter alia GSA commissions, IT services, travel & entertainment, office rental and equipment, legal, audit and consulting fees, telecommunication expenses and net worth tax, decreased by 0.5% to US$ 114.3 million. Taking all of the preceding into account, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for the year was US$ 59.5 million compared to US$ 8.0 million in 2012. The EBIT margin was 3.0%. Financial income decreased by 22.9% to US$ 8.6 million. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Financial expenses increased by 22.0% to US$ 59.2 million. The movement in financial expenses was due mainly to the acquisition of three Boeing 747-8 freighters. Net finance costs were US$ 50.5 million (2012: US$ 37.3 million). The Gain before tax was US$ 8.8 million (2012: Loss before tax of US$ 34.7 million) and the net after tax gain was US$ 8.4 million (2012: Loss of US$ 35.1 million). Tax adjustments Current tax for the year amounted to US$ 0.4 million (2012: US$ 0.4 million). In 2013, the Company did not account for any adjustment of deferred taxes and did not increase the related deferred tax asset due to the extreme volatility of market conditions. After these adjustments, the net after tax gain for 2013 was US$ 8.4 million (2012: Loss of US$ 35.1 million). 21 Financial review and analysis As at December 31, 2013 Balance sheet Total assets increased by 14.7% to US$ 2,549.5 million from US$ 2,223.0 million due mainly to the acquisition of three Boeing 747-8 freighter aircraft. Shareholders’ equity increased by 8.9% to US$ 468.9 million from US$ 430.7 million. Interest bearing liabilities (including finance leases) increased by 28.1% to US$ 1,572.5 million from US$ 1,228.0 million due mainly to the financing of the three additional Boeing 747-8 freighter aircraft. Cash and cash equivalents and Other investments increased by 14.2% from US$ 227.9 million to US$ 260.3 million due mainly to the cash contribution from operations, the issuance of a mandatorily convertible bond offset by investing in new aircraft and the repayment of loans. Net financial gearing amounted to 279.9% (2012: 232.2%) and net adjusted gearing (to take into account the present value of future operating lease payments) was 324.9% (2012: 288.6%). Fleet development In 2013, Cargolux took delivery of three Boeing 747-8 freighters and returned its last GE-powered Boeing 747-400 freighter to the lessor. At December 31, 2013, Cargolux operated a fleet of twenty aircraft of which nine were Boeing 747-8 freighters, seven Boeing 747-400 freighters and another four Boeing 747-400 freighters under flexible lease arrangements. In 2014, the Company aims to maintain as much fleet flexibility as possible given the weak and uncertain market conditions. Two Boeing 747-8 freighters are scheduled for delivery in 2014. Branch network The Company operates worldwide through a network of branches established in 29 countries (2012:29). cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Outlook and recent developments Following a positive result in 2013 of US$ 8.4 million, the Company foresees a positive result with a slight improvement in the 2014 Budget. Certain positive exceptional items in 2013, not repeating themselves in 2014, will be offset by an expected slight growth in yields and demand as well as by the enhanced profitability of the additional Boeing 747-8 freighters. In early 2014, the Company further refined its 5-year business plan reflecting the Company’s strategy for the period 2014-2018. This included the purchase order of an additional Boeing 747-8 freighter (14th). The plan has been adopted and endorsed by the Board of Directors. However, in order to provide for the re-fleeting program and to replace liquidity absorbed by certain non-recurring 22 outflows over the past several years, the directors have requested the shareholders, who have agreed on April 23, 2014, to inject additional equity into the airline, amounting to US$ 175 million to be made available on the same day. In 2013, all committed credit facilities remained unused. Such committed credit lines amounted in the aggregate to US$ 34.1 million at year-end 2013. The 2014 Budget foresees no breach in financial covenants for that same period. The Company continuously monitors the environment for such risks and in respect of those under our control, has in place existing safeguards, including legal and operational compliance reviews, aircraft maintenance quality programs and IT security measures to protect against unauthorized entry into our systems. The Company’s Aircraft and Third Party Liability insurance coverage is also in line with industry best practice and satisfies specific financing contractual obligations. As regards instances of events out of our control, such as occurred when volcanic ash clouds disrupted flight operations, these tend to affect the industry as a whole and Cargolux would work together with the relevant authorities, including other airlines, to ensure minimum disruption to normal operations. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 23 Overall business review The difficult economic conditions, that have severely affected the air cargo industry for a number of years, persisted throughout 2013, although we saw encouraging signs in some areas of our network. In contrast to the industry trend, Cargolux was able to increase its tonnage by 16.7% over 2012 to 753,848 tonnes and grew revenues by 13.4% to US$ 1.9 billion. Our average system-wide load factor reached 67.7% against 68.6% in 2012. That, however, must be seen against a substantial expansion in the Cargolux fleet that consisted of 20 Boeing 747 freighters at the end of year, whereas the budget only foresaw the operation of 16 aircraft. Cargolux Airlines and Cargolux Italia operated 95,022 block hours, 13,364 hours more than the 2013 budget foresaw. The high amount of operational activities stressed the system considerably, but enabled us to achieve a very satisfactory result that showed a net consolidated gain of US$ 8.4 million, a noteworthy improvement over the originally budgeted loss of US$ 27.1 million for 2013. Our employees achieved this remarkable performance with hard work and unwavering commitment to the company. As a team, we successfully played on our strengths – flexibility and dedication. 2013 was an exemplary year as to how Cargolux could make the most out of a difficult situation. With a bigger fleet and more operational activities than planned, we saw an average daily aircraft utilization of 14:57 hours, slightly lower than in 2012. Our market share reached 3.5% and Cargolux ranked at No. 8 among the world’s airlines in FTKs. Network In 2013, Cargolux grew its network with 12 new destinations; Bamako, Buenos Aires, Columbus, Dallas, Munich, Muscat, Ouagadougou, Port Harcourt, Santiago de Chile, Vienna, Tripoli and Zaragoza. We kept the network as flexible as possible to minimize losses and achieve satisfactory revenues. This helped to soften the impact of the difficult market situation somewhat. The worldwide Cargolux network registered growth in both FTKs and ATKs. Due to the expanded fleet, ATK growth was particularly strong. Throughout the year, we added three new 747-8Fs and one 747-400ERF that became available. We also retained on a power-by-the-hour basis the two dry-leased 747-400BCFs and one 747-400F that was originally scheduled to leave the fleet. Our growing 747-8 freighter fleet continued to perform well, both operationally and economically. The aircraft has proven to be a solid and reliable workhorse for Cargolux. In 2014, we expect the delivery of another two units. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 The Areas Overall, our areas put in a respectable performance with above-budget growth. In terms of yield, Areas 1, 2 and 4 performed fairly well, while Area 3 was affected the most by weak markets during the summer. However, it was also the market that enjoyed the fastest recovery at the end of the year, showing a very strong performance between October and December, particularly out of Hong Kong and, to a lesser extent, Shanghai. Area 1 – The Americas In a year that offered no shortage of challenges, Cargolux in the Americas managed to outperform the vast majority of its competitors with regards to FTK and market share growth, while maintaining positive yields. The challenges 24 included, but were not limited to, increasingly aggressive competition, flat air cargo demand and continued capacity growth which resulted in significant and continuous downward pressure on yields. With the obvious implications that considerable increases in capacity during tough economic conditions presents, the Cargolux Americas team met the challenges with coordinated and intensified sales efforts at both local and global account management levels. Also contributing to the Americas record-setting performance and facilitating diversification was a more focused engagement with charter, part-charter and some short term wet-lease activities. Cargolux remains a major supplier of capacity in the North American market and, with its significant growth in 2013, is now providing capacity in excess of 3,000 tonnes per week, an increase of 35% over 2012, from 13 online origins: Atlanta, Calgary, Chicago, Dallas, Guadalajara, Houston, Huntsville, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Miami, New York, and Seattle. While Cargolux increased frequencies at several established destinations, including more services on the transpacific lane between Asia, the United States and Europe, where frequencies increased from three to seven, such ambitious growth plans would not have been achievable merely by adding frequencies to the same well-established markets. In North America, Dallas and Columbus were brought online in order to nurture and grow those markets for both inbound and outbound customer requirements. Additionally, in order to support the rapidly growing auto industry in the Southeast, a direct Atlanta to Munich flight was introduced. These new or additional services saw an overwhelmingly positive reception from our customers. The Latin American market continues to be critical for Cargolux. With significant growth in 2013, the region has in no small part facilitated our expansion in the Americas. Cargolux is now providing approximately 800 tonnes of capacity per week, 43% more than at the end of 2012, from nine origins: Aguadilla, Bogota, Buenos Aires, Curitiba, Latacunga, Manaus, Petrolina, Santiago, and São Paulo. The re-launching of services to and from Buenos Aires, Argentina and Santiago de Chile further underlined our commitment to expand our global footprint and diversify the market portfolio in order to meet changing customer requirements. Collectively, the Americas produced 155,256 tonnes, 22,581 tonnes or +17% more than the previous year, and a total revenue that exceeded US$ 334 million, an increase of 9.7% over 2012. Area 1 experienced a remarkable upward movement in terms of tonnage carried and ultimately raised our market share by 9.4%. Tonnage growth in North America was largely attributable to Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, and Chicago. Meanwhile, São Paulo, Latacunga, Santiago, and Aguadilla contributed significantly toward tonnage growth in Latin America. Area 2 – Europe, Middle East and Central Asia Despite difficult market conditions that affected Cargolux Area 2, European airfreight exports remained steady or showed a minor increase versus the negative trend of 2012. In view of these challenges, we managed double digit cargolux | Annual Report 2013 tonnage growth, which, in turn, led to an increase in market share in all European markets. Area 2 generated 341,277 tonnes of freight in 2013, an increase of 18% over the previous year. This was made possible by the significant increase in our scheduled services but also because we kept our average yield stable for the second year running. The area’s contribution to the company results, with 42% in revenue and 45% of the overall Cargolux tonnage production, remained on a similar level as in 2012. Overall, Cargolux Area 2 generated revenues of close to US$ 809 million. With the growing capacity demand in and out of Asia, Area 2 showed a 25% increase in volumes into Asia over 2012. On flights to the Americas, we saw an overall increase of 18%, with Viracopos and Mexico City showing the highest growth and the new destinations Dallas, Santiago di Chile and Buenos Aires, added during 2013, showing good loads as well. Within Area 2, we added Muscat as a new destination, reintroduced Abu Dhabi to our scheduled operation and added a frequency to Tbilisi, Riyadh and Istanbul each. In addition, we started project-linked feeder flights to Munich and Zaragoza. 25 Overall business review In the latter part of 2013, we appointed a new General Sales Agent in Poland, Romania and the Baltic countries. These efforts led to a production increase of 10%. With new services to Africa and more freight to Kinshasa and N’Djamena, we achieved an 8% increase in volumes from Area 2 destinations to Africa. Area 3 – Asia Pacific 2013 was a difficult year for Cargolux Asia Pacific. While the first quarter of 2013 still benefited from the upswing at the end of 2012, markets declined considerably from the second quarter on. Demand to Europe remained stagnant and rates started to fall sharply. In the midst of this, however, we experienced stable volumes on our existing three weekly Hong Kong USA flights, not least because of our efficient and economical 747-8 freighters that fly the transpacific routes. Consequently, we expanded our transpacific services out of Hong Kong from March on and, by July, offered seven weekly flights linking Hong Kong with Los Angeles, Dallas, Ohio, Chicago and New York City. By the third quarter, we saw signs of recovery of the European markets that prompted us to re-introduce a twice weekly Hong Kong – Vienna service. Vietnam performed exceptionally well in the region. Besides our weekly frequency linking Ho Chi Minh City with Barcelona and Luxembourg, we added an additional Vienna service from Hanoi during the year, for a total of three services with direct connections to Budapest and Vienna. Overall, the 2013 performance of our Hong Kong, Seoul, Xiamen and Taipei operations remained stable. We operated more than 20 extra Hong Kong flights during the last quarter of the year. Competition in Shanghai remained fierce; however, with the continuing support of our customers, we are able to sustain our daily service in Shanghai. The same applied to our Beijing, Japan and South-East Asia operations. With the World Cup in Brazil coming up next year, we saw a growing amount of exports to São Paulo from the third quarter of 2013 on, especially from Korea and China. The release of the much anticipated X-Box One, Sony PS4, 4K Ultra HD TVs and iPad Air in the fourth quarter brought a slight but welcomed rise in freight volumes that was good news for the Asian airfreight industry. Throughout the year, Area 3 produced a total of 196,956 tonnes of cargo, a 19.2% increase compared to 2012. The total revenue increased by 13.7% to US$661 million. Area 4 – Africa 2013 proved difficult for our African operation, due to the fact that demand from Asian markets had not gone back to pre-crisis levels. Added to that, the market saw significant overcapacity, especially in Kenya and South Africa, cargolux | Annual Report 2013 with the resulting low yields and load factors. The little growth we saw in Africa was mostly absorbed by the steady addition of wide-body passenger aircraft that offered enough belly capacity. It is expected that their continuous dominance is pushing out traditional freighter operations in certain niche markets. In this volatile environment, we concentrated on retaining a close presence to the market and to our customers who helped us to consolidate our foothold in the region and benefited from a reliable delivery service especially at difficult destinations. We added three new destinations to our African services, Bamako, Ouagadougou and Port Harcourt, that showed promising performances. In 2013, the area produced 50,812 tonnes of freight, representing a growth of 4.6% versus 2012. Revenues, how26 ever, declined by 3.1% to US$ 70 million. For 2014, we expect to stabilize the African network with additional routes and destinations. Cargolux Italia In 2013, Cargolux Italia was able to further improve the leading position of the Cargolux Group in the airfreight market and remain the leading cargo carrier out of Italy. Cargolux Italia carried 93,106 tonnes of freight, a 29.5% increase over the 71,880 tonnes flown in 2012. FTKs reached 440,397. Cargolux Italia flew 5,449 block hours, utilizing its own aircraft, LX-KCV, for the first half of the year and its new 747-400F, LX-YCV which replaced LX-KCV from July 2013 on. The company also used wet-leased capacity from Cargolux for operations to Brazil, the United States and Mexico. These flights operated another 2,503 block hours for a total of 7,952 Cargolux Italia block hours. The company’s gross turnover reached US$ 143 million, compared to US$ 123 million in 2012. Cargolux ownership In December 2012, the Luxembourg government acquired the 35% Cargolux shareholding from Qatar Airways on an interim basis, with the intention of bringing a suitable strategic partner on board. In early 2014, the government of Luxembourg opted for Henan Civil Aviation Development & Investment Co., Ltd., (HNCA), the investment arm of Chinese province Henan to become the future owner of these shares. The share sale and purchase agreement, was closed on April 23, 2014. In addition, the Luxembourg government decided to retain an active role in Cargolux by acquiring a 8.32% stake from Luxair, effective April 22, 2014. According to a partnership agreement between Cargolux and HNCA, the two companies intend to develop a dual hub strategy, with Luxembourg airport as the key hub in Europe on one side and Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport on the other side, spurred by the implementation of a weekly flight program between both hubs. Well positioned to profit from the trade movements generated by one of the world’s most dynamic and fastest developing economies and a country with an accelerating domestic appetite for goods shipped by air, the partnership with HNCA will contribute to the sustainable development of Cargolux by allowing us to grow our business and expand our activities. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Charter In 2013, a host of new players entered the charter market, including a number of airlines that had no history in that field but proceeded to drive yields down with low offers. Added to that, some forwarders changed from getting direct quotes from airlines to using brokers that collected offers from all over the market. Cargolux relied on enough charter capacity, operating two 747 freighters at the beginning of the year and, later, four on a power-by-the-hour basis that could offer not only competitive rates but also the required flexibility and shortnotice readiness for logistics solutions that charter customers need. Consequently, we flew a number of charters with 24 hours’ notice, such as 13 flights with gearboxes to Detroit within the space of 17 days. These and other services made June the busiest charter month of the year with 26 flights. Half of our 2013 charters were operated for the automotive industry and included test vehicles or racing cars for most of the major European car manufacturers as well as for Formula One. 27 Overall business review In contrast to the short-notice flights, other operations required months of careful planning such as the flights for Swiss company Solar Impulse that carried their record-breaking solar-powered craft from a small Swiss airfield barely large enough to accommodate a Boeing 747 to the United States. After a much noticed and successful solar powered flight across the United States, Solar Impulse was safely carried back home to Switzerland in the expert hands of Cargolux. Despite these successful high-profile and bread-and-butter charter flights, 2013 did not shape up to be a record year for the Cargolux charter activities due to low-ball offers and overcapacity in the market. However, it contributed nicely to the bottom line in a very competitive environment. Outlook In 2014, we expect the supply/demand imbalance to improve somewhat, benefiting from a better market growth at around 4%. Rates and load factors also should stabilize and yields should slightly improve by the end of the year. In this environment, Cargolux will continue to grow, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2013. We anticipate continued volume growth, contributing to offset our rising fixed costs. The cooperation with our new Chinese shareholders will help to boost growth and explore new markets and opportunities. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 28 2013 5,723 (in millions) 2012 4,800 2011 5,039 Tonne-kilometers flown 2010 5,284 2013 753,848 2012 645,759 2011 658,800 Total metric tonnes sold 2010 683,380 cargolux | Annual Report 2013 29 Maintenance & Engineering Fleet support The main focus of the Maintenance & Engineering Division (M&E) lies on the support of the 747 freighter fleets of Cargolux Airlines and Cargolux Italia. While Cargolux Italia continued to fly its single 747-400F, Cargolux Airlines operated a mixed fleet of 747-8Fs, 747-400Fs and 747-400BCFs. LX-KCV returned from lease to Cargolux Italia in the summer and was replaced at the Italian carrier by LX-YCV. After going through a final maintenance check, LXKCV left the Cargolux fleet and was returned to the lessor. As planned, the fleet rollover to the 747-8F continued with three deliveries in 2013. Cargolux started the year with six units and operated nine Boeing 747-8Fs at the end of 2013. The combined Cargolux and Cargolux Italia fleet grew from 17 to 20 aircraft, the largest fleet in the airline’s history. 747-8F experience With nine 747-8 freighters in operation, Cargolux M&E has gained solid expertise and experience with the aircraft type. The Cargolux maintenance staff was able to assist several other 747-8F operators in expediently resolving the technical issues these operators experienced and thus expand M&E’s commercial service portfolio. The teething problems that the aircraft saw in the previous year, mainly related to the new systems and engines, have been overcome and the type has performed extremely well. Schedule reliability With a significantly higher operational activity than planned for 2013, Cargolux produced 95,022 block hours, a 17.1% increase compared to 2012. This had a major impact on the workload of M&E and required further productivity improvements. Despite this growth, M&E was able to improve the schedule reliability for the 747-8F throughout the year and achieved an average of 98.3%, while the 747-400F fleet reached a schedule reliability of 98.8%. In 2014, Cargolux expects to receive another two 747-8 freighters, bringing the total number of this model to 11 units. By the fourth quarter of 2014, the combined Cargolux/Cargolux Italia fleet will comprise 22 aircraft, offering increased flexibility in our operation. It will require the M&E division to continue to search for further productivity improvements. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Hangar maintenance In its regular maintenance program for 2013, Cargolux M&E performed 89 A-checks and 4 C-checks on the Cargolux and Cargolux Italia fleets, including the first 2 C-checks on the 747-8F. Two D-checks on 747-400 freighters were outsourced to Singapore, supported by our M&E team. During 2013, we employed 409 staff, roughly on the same level as in 2012, and produced 494,000 man hours. Caring for customers Cargolux M&E has a well-deserved reputation for its excellent customer services, offering maintenance checks on 30 various aircraft types. These include, apart from the 747, the 737, 757 and 767. Regular visitors to our maintenance center in 2013 included the aircraft of Silkway Airways, Air Bridge Cargo, Atlas Air, Corsair and Air Atlanta. Most of these airlines sent their 747-400s to us, however, we also saw an increasing number of 747-8 aircraft that benefited from our quality maintenance work, including the fleets of Air Bridge Cargo and Atlas Air. Our broad range of services was further expanded during 2013, enabling us to perform 44 A-checks and 7 C-checks on customer aircraft. Revenue from third-party work in 2013 was up by 36%, from US$ 25 million in 2012 to US$ 34 million. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 31 cargolux | Annual Report 2013 32 cargolux | Annual Report 2013 33 Flight Operations Cargolux continued its fleet rollover program with the acceptance of three new Boeing 747-8 freighters during 2013. LX-VCA joined the fleet in March, LX-VCH in May and LX-VCI in September. With more units of the advanced freighter in our fleet, we could further reduce our direct operational costs as well as improve our performance and efficiency. In addition, we continued to operate the two Boeing-owned 747-400BCFs on a power-by-the-hour basis throughout the year. Our 747-400F LX-OCV was scheduled to leave the fleet in July, however, we continued to operate the aircraft on a power-by-the-hour basis for the remainder of the year. Another unplanned addition to the fleet was LX-ECV, a 747-400ERF that became available at favorable conditions and joined the fleet in November. 747-400F LX-KCV returned from lease to Cargolux Italia in July and, after maintenance, was handed back to its owner. Cargolux Italia replaced the aircraft with LX-YCV, the youngest 747-400F in the Cargolux fleet. At the end of 2013, Cargolux operated a fleet of 20 aircraft, composed of 9 Boeing 747-400Fs, 2 Boeing 747-400BCFs and 9 Boeing 747-8Fs. In contrast, the budget for 2013 only foresaw a fleet of 16 aircraft. High utilization Cargolux Airlines and Cargolux Italia flew 95,022 block hours, 13,364 hours more than foreseen in the 2013 budget. The additional hours seriously taxed the system and were only possible through the flexibility and hard work of everyone in the organization. It had an impact not only on the flight operations team and crews but also on maintenance, ground operations and the sales organization. The high number of additional hours was achieved through the unplanned fleet additions mentioned above and a higher utilization of the existing fleet. Cargolux traditionally has one of the highest daily aircraft utilization rates for the 747 in the industry, 2013 was no exception, even though the figures were slightly lower for the 747-400F fleet than in 2012. The 747-8F achieved an average daily utilization of 15:58 hours, while the 747-400F averaged 14:04 hours. The two 747-400BCFs, that only operated when additional capacity was needed, achieved an average daily utilization of 7:35 hours, flying twice as many flight hours as budgeted. The on-time performance was slightly lower than in 2012 (-0.9%), however, this must be seen against the substantial increase in flight hours and flight sectors. Our network flight sectors increased by 17.5% to 17,461. Flight rotations out of Luxembourg reached 3,655 an increase of 14.6% against 2012. Flight delays also resulted from network routing changes and ad-hoc sectors to optimize revenues, ground delays related to customer requests and special attention freight, such as offsize loads or live animal handling. Airport curfews, slot restrictions and cargolux | Annual Report 2013 crew rest delays, resulting from the domino effect that flight delays have on crew rosters, also added to the slight decrease in on-time performance. Cargolux uses cargo-specific key performance indicators (KPIs) for the calculation of its on-time performance that differ from passenger operator related KPIs. Our Pit Stop Program, designed to recover delays at stations by reducing ground time, was able to recover a total of 844.16 hours throughout the year, or 58.3% of all flights delayed over 1 hour. However, operating a fleet mix of 747-400F, 747-400BCF and 747-8F aircraft makes it difficult to recover additional allocated ground time. Training The Cargolux 747-8F flight simulator that operated at Level C since May 2012 was upgraded to Level D and recertified by Luxembourg’s civil aviation authority ‘Direction de l’Aviation Civile’. The upgrade necessitated a three34 month downtime and the simulator went back into operation on 10 September. The CAE-built unit was the world’s first 747-8F full flight simulator in operation and was delivered to Cargolux mid-2011. On 31 December, Cargolux employed 425 pilots. During the year, 20 pilots, 5 captains and 15 first officers, were hired on one-year contracts to ease the pressure of the additional flight hours operated in 2013. These crews were already type-rated on the 747-400 and went through an operator’s conversion course for the 747-8. All other Cargolux pilots are already type-rated for both the 747-400 and the 747-8 and only went through the necessary recurrent trainings in 2013. Nine first officers were promoted to captain. Cargolux also made its simulators available for external customers, these included Silkway and GSS. In total, the 747-400 simulator recorded 2,752 hours for Cargolux, 446 hours for Cargolux Italia and 860 hours for external customers. The 747-8 simulator recorded 1,577 hours for Cargolux and 60 hours for external customers. The lower utilization for the 747-8 simulator was due to the three-month maintenance period during the Level D upgrade. 747-8 network In previous years, we experienced network challenges as not every airport we operated to was certified for the 747-8. This has meanwhile been rectified and, in 2013, our 747-8 freighters have operated to 94 airports worldwide, including 89 commercial destinations and 5 alternate airports. In 2013, we added 12 new scheduled destinations to the network. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 35 Consolidated financial statements Consolidated income statement For the year ended December 31, 2013 In

the consolidated financial statements 1. Reporting entity The parent company, Cargolux Airlines International S.A. (the “Company” or “Cargolux”), was incorporated on March 4, 1970 and is registered as a “société anonyme” under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The registered address of the Company is Aéroport de Luxembourg, L-2990 Sandweiler, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg and the registration number is R.C. Luxembourg B 008.916. The Company is an all-cargo airline. It also maintains its own aircraft and provides third party maintenance and flight operations assistance (including crew training) to third parties at its Luxembourg headquarters. As at the balance sheet date, operations outside of Luxembourg that relate to the Company’s business activities are conducted solely under branch offices, except for Italy, where Cargolux mainly conducts its business through its subsidiary Cargolux Italia S.p.A., an all-cargo airline based in Milan. As at the balance sheet date the Company maintained branches in 29 countries. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2013, comprise the Company and its subsidiaries, Cargolux RE S.A., Cargolux Italia S.p.A. and Italia Aerologistics S.R.L. (together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. 2. Basis of preparation (a) Statement of compliance The Group prepares its financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors approved the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 on April, 23, 2014 and authorized the publication of said financial statements on April 30, 2014, following confirmation by the shareholders thereof on that date. (b) Basis of measurement The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items in the financial statements: cargolux | Annual Report 2013 • derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value, • the defined benefit liability is recognized as the net total of: fair value of plan assets plus service cost, actuarial losses minus actuarial gains and the present value of the defined benefit obligation. (c) Going concern The Group believes that the operating cash flows, the credit facilities in place and the injection of additional cash (US$ 175 million) through a capital increase will secure the liquidity needs of the Group for the foreseeable future and at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements (see Notes 5 (e), 21, 22 and 32). Consequently, the financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the assumption of the Company’s ability to operate as a going concern. (d) Functional and presentation currency 46 The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States Dollar (“US dollar” or “US$”) as the functional currency US dollars are rounded to the nearest thousand. (e) Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors: these estimates and related assumptions are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and on their basis judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be derived from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are given effect in the period during which the estimate was revised and in any future periods affected. Judgments made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements are discussed in Note 31. (f) Changes in accounting policies Except for the changes explained in Note 3 (r), the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. However, certain comparative amounts in the financial statements and in the notes thereto have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation. 3. Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of consolidation (i) Subsidiaries Companies in which the Group exercises exclusive control are fully consolidated. Control exists when the Group has the power directly or indirectly to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from the entity’s activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable (e.g. under option agreements) are taken into account. The consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 (ii) Associates and joint ventures Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognized gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. Typically associates where the Group controls 20% or more of the equity but does not exercise control and joint ventures are equity accounted. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to make payments or has made payments on behalf of that investee. (iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealized gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions with fully consolidated entities are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized 47 Notes to the consolidated financial statements gains and losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. (iv) Special purpose entities The Group has established a number of special purpose entities (SPEs) for aircraft financing purposes. Generally the Group does not have any direct or indirect shareholding in these entities. An SPE is consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the Group and the SPEs’ risks and rewards with respect of the asset in its balance sheet, the Group concludes that it controls the SPEs. SPEs controlled by the Group are always established under terms that impose strict limitations on the decision-making powers of the SPEs’ management and that result in the Group receiving all of the benefits related to the SPEs’ operations and net assets. (b) Foreign currency (i) Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the Group at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the foreign exchange rates applicable at the balance sheet date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the value of the item expressed in the functional currency at the beginning of the period and the value of the item expressed in functional currency at the end of the period, using for translation purposes the exchange rate prevailing at the end of each relevant date. The year-end value reflects, if and as applicable, amortization, payments and interest accruals effected during the year. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are stated at historical cost less amortization are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated into the functional currency at foreign exchange rates applicable at the date the fair value is determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognized in the income statement. (ii) Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of entities controlled by the Group that have a functional currency other than the US dollar (“foreign operations”) are translated into US dollar at foreign exchange rates applicable at the balance sheet date. The rule also applies to goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation of foreign operations. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into US dollar at rates applicable at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognized directly in a separate comcargolux | Annual Report 2013 ponent of equity. (c) Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices arising from operational and financing activities. In accordance with its hedging policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are treated as trading instruments. The gain or loss in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in the income statement unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, in which case the effective part of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any gain or loss with respect to the ineffective part of hedge accounted instruments (as are gains or losses on trading instruments) is recognized in the income statement. 48 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognized in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the period. (d) Property, plant and equipment (i) Aircraft and equipment B747-400F and B747-8F aircraft (including installed engines) and rotable spare parts (including spare engines) are stated at cost, adjusted for any impairment, less accumulated depreciation. Borrowing costs related to the acquisition of an aircraft are capitalized as part of the cost of this aircraft. The initial cost of the aircraft includes the first “D-check” as a separate component. The costs of subsequent “D-checks” are capitalized when the first “D-check” (or second or third “D-check”, as the case may be) occurs and the capitalized “D-check” is depreciated over the period to the next scheduled “D-check”. The period of depreciation of “D-checks” is set forth in (v) below. (ii) Other property, plant and equipment Other items of property, plant and equipment are also stated at cost less accumulated depreciation (see (v) below) and impairment, if applicable (on which see (j)). Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment (see (v) below). (iii) Leased assets 1) Finance leases: Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. The assets acquired by way of finance leases are recognized as non-current assets and are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum future lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation (see (v)) and impairment, if any (on which see (j)). The related liability is included under Finance lease liabilities. In the context of sale and leaseback transactions, the recognition of any gain on the sale is deferred and recognized instead as finance income over the lease term. No loss is recognized unless the asset is impaired. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 2) Operating leases: Leases under the terms of which the Group does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases and are not carried on the Group’s balance sheet. The net present value of future lease payments under operating leases is disclosed in the notes to these financial statements (see Note 26). In the context of sale and leaseback transactions, the related gains are accounted for as follows: • they are immediately recognized as income when the transaction is realized at fair market value, • they are deferred and amortized over the lease term when the transaction is realized under or over fair value. (iv) Subsequent costs The Group outsources the major aircraft overhaul checks, as well as the maintenance and repairs of engines to outside contractors, however performs the major overhaul “C-checks” internally. The cost related to line maintenance, “A-checks” and “C-checks” performed in Luxembourg are expensed when incurred under various line items in the income statement. 49 Notes to the consolidated financial statements (v) Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component or part of aircraft and other property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives and residual values of relevant assets are as follows: Useful life (average) Residual value (average) Components of aircraft: •Airframe 20 years 15% of initial cost •Engines (RB 211, GEnx) 13 years 7% of initial cost •1st and 2nd “D-check” 8 years nil •Subsequent “D-checks” 6 years nil •Rotable spare parts 10 years nil Equipment: 5 years nil Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed periodically as circumstances warrant. Depreciation is discontinued when the carrying amount of the asset is below its residual or sale value. (e) Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are accounted for in accordance with the basis for consolidation (see (a)). (f) Investments Treasury instruments are carried at fair value with variations in value flowing through the income statement. These assets are classified as current assets in Other investments. Related transaction costs are expensed when incurred. Financial instruments are recognized / derecognized by the Group on the date it commits to purchase / sell the instruments. (g) Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment (on which see (j)). (h) Expendable parts and supplies cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Expendable parts and supplies are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventories are carried on a first-in-first-out basis. Net realizable value is the estimated market price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated sales costs. Expendable parts and supplies are charged to Aircraft maintenance expenses when used. (i) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call and short term deposits and shares in money market funds. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of Cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Cash Flows. (j) Impairment (i) Non-financial assets 50 The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than expendable parts and supplies (on which see (h) above) and deferred tax assets (on which see (q)), are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any impairment. If any impairment exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and the carrying value adjusted accordingly. Impairment is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement. Calculation of recoverable amount: The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value (less costs to sell) and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows to be derived from the use of the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Impairment is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization. (ii) Financial assets A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset carried at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its fair value. Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized. For financial assets carried at amortized cost and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognized in profit or loss. For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the reversal is recognized directly in equity. (k) Interest-bearing liabilities and finance lease liabilities Interest-bearing liabilities and finance lease liabilities are recognized initially at principal amount less related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing liabilities are stated at amortized amount using the cargolux | Annual Report 2013 effective interest rate method. (l) Employee benefits Retirement benefit costs The Group maintains defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes for its Luxembourg-based employees. Premiums paid to the insurance company in relation to defined contribution retirement benefit plan are charged as an expense as they fall due. The defined benefit scheme in Luxembourg is accounted for as such under IAS 19, using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date (see Note 23). Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized immediately in Other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss. 51 Notes to the consolidated financial statements (m) Provisions A provision is recognized in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or contractual obligation that can be estimated reliably as a result of a past event and if it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle this obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Accruals related to those provisions are recognized as finance cost over the period. Heavy maintenance costs (“D-checks”) relating to aircraft under operating leases are recognized as provisions on the basis of the heavy maintenance supplier agreement. The Group accrues for delivery costs related to aircraft under operating leases as soon as it becomes apparent that the asset does not meet the return condition criteria set forth in the lease agreement. (n) Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost. (o) Revenue Services rendered Cargo sales, net of discounts, are recognized as revenue when the transportation service is provided. Other revenue, primarily third party aircraft maintenance, is also recognized when the service is rendered. (p) Expenses (i) Operating lease payments Rentals paid under operating leases are recognized in the income statement over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognized in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease. (ii) Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognized in the income statement using the effective interest rate method. (iii) Net finance costs Net finance costs comprise the net result of (i) interest payable on borrowings, and (ii) interest receivable on funds cargolux | Annual Report 2013 invested (Cash and cash equivalents and Other investments), and gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on Other investments and on interest rate hedging instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting (see (c)). Interest income is recognized in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method where appropriate. Dividend income is recognized in the income statement as Other operating income on the date the Group’s right to receive the payments is established. (q) Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity or in Other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates applicable at the balance 52 sheet date, subject to any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Taxes that are not assessed on the Group’s income (e.g. Net worth tax) are recognized in Other operating expenses. Deferred tax is computed using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary differences related to Investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not be reversed in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realization or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. (r) New and amended standards adopted by the Group The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2013. a. Presentation of items of Other comprehensive income (Amendments to IAS 1) b. Post-employment defined benefit plans (IAS 19, 2011) c. Fair value measurement (IFRS 13) The nature and effects of the changes are explained below. a. Presentation of items of Other comprehensive income (“OCI”) As a result of the amendment to IAS 1, the Group has modified the presentation of items of OCI in its statement of profit or loss and OCI, to present separately items that would be reclassified to profit or loss from those that would never be. b. Post-employment defined benefit plans As a result of IAS 19 (2011), the Group has changed its accounting policy (note 3 (l)) with respect to the basis for determining the incomes or expenses related to its post-employment defined benefits plans. The amended standard introduces a requirement to fully recognize changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) including immediate recognition of defined benefit costs, and requires disaggregation of the overall defined benefit cost into components and requiring the recognition of remeasurements in other comprehensive income (eliminating the ‘corridor’ approach). The Group did not restate the comparative figures in preparing these financial statements as the impact is not significant. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 c. Fair value measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosure about fair value measurements when such measurements are required or permitted by other IFRS. It unifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It replaces and expands the disclosure requirements about fair value measurements in other IFRSs, including IFRS 7. As a result, the Group did not have to include additional disclosures in this regard. (s) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning January 1, 2013 and not early adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these separate financial statements. Those which may be relevant to the Group are set out below. The Group does not plan to adopt these standards early. 53 Notes to the consolidated financial statements IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (2010), IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (2009) IFRS 9 (2009) introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. Under IFRS 9 (2009), financial assets are classified and measured based on the business model in which they are held and the characteristics of their contractual cash flows. IFRS 9 (2010) introduces additional changes relating to financial liabilities. IFRS 9 (2010) and IFRS 9 (2009) are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015, with early adoption permitted. 4. Determination of fair values A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and / or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. Where applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability. (i) Investments in equity securities The fair value of financial assets is determined by reference to their quoted bid price at the reporting date. (ii) Derivatives Fair values of hedging instruments, representing unrealized gains and losses, are determined on the balance sheet date based on third party pricings and valuations, including valuations provided by the Group’s counterparties to the hedging transactions. Where feasible any counterparty valuation is verified by the Group using independent sources. The values assume a normal functioning of financial markets. Market volatility will necessarily have an impact on said pricings and valuations as well as the Group’s eventual liability with respect of the hedging instruments booked at the balance sheet date. (iii) Other financial assets/liabilities The fair value of non-current receivables and payables is determined by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at the fair value (on which see Note 3 (j) above). 5. Financial risks and risk management cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Risk management framework The Group has exposure to the following risks with respect of its financial assets and use of financial instruments: • credit risk • liquidity risk • market risk The objective of risk management is to manage and control risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the benefit expected to be derived from the investing and risk management activities, respectively. Credit risk 54 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument or issuer of a security owned by the Group fails to meet its contractual obligations because of insolvency, bankruptcy or similar event. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s assets or reputation. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in asset prices resulting from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates. Interest rates or fuel prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. General This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, as well as the Group’s objectives and policies for the management of excess cash. Where applicable, further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has established the Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for executing and monitoring the Group’s risk management policies. The Risk Management Committee reports on a regular basis to the Board of Directors and its Audit Committee on the committee’s activities and on the evolution of the Group’s derivative portfolio. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, to determine appropriate instruments to protect the Group against risks and to monitor risks and financial limits. Risk management policies and procedures are reviewed as required to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which employees involved in the risk management activity understand their respective roles and obligations. Risk management policies The Group buys derivatives in order to manage market risks. In connection with purchases of derivatives, the 55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Group sometimes also sells derivatives. Such transactions are carried out within the risk management framework and control mechanisms described below. Where possible the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting for those instruments in order to reduce volatility in profit or loss. The Group’s risk management policy prohibits short selling of options. Investment policy The primary goal of the Group’s investment policy is to maximize investment returns while always protecting the invested capital. To this effect, the Group invests excess cash, subject to limits established in its treasury policy, in investment funds, bank deposits, zero-coupons and structured products with a capital guarantee at maturity. The return on structured products depends on the performance of the underlying used, which may be equities, commodities, indices, currencies, securities or interest rates. Structured products are designated as Other investments and recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with any change in value flowing through the income statement. The Group does only purchase securities or structured investment products from a counterparty having a minimum, pre-determined credit rating and which makes a daily market in those securities or financial instruments. (a) Credit risk Cash, derivatives and other financial instruments Generally, the Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only making deposits with, investing in securities issued by and buying protection from counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least BBBfrom Standard & Poor’s and Fitch and Baa1 from Moody’s. Any exception to this rule must be approved by the Risk Management Committee and is closely monitored and reported to Excom and the Board of Directors. Credit limits for each counterparty are in place and monitored on an ongoing basis. This enables the Group to cap the maximum amount of business that can be transacted with any given counterparty. Compliance with those credit limits is monitored on a daily basis. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Trade and other receivables The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of the customer and the demographics of the Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate. The Group distinguishes between countries considered as low risk and countries of higher risk depending on their geographical and political situation and monitors customers on either list separately. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 The Credit Committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer not paying through CASS (Cargo Accounts Settlement Systems) is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount allowed for trading without requiring approval from the Credit Committee; these limits are reviewed regularly. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis or if they can offer collateral e.g. bank guarantees or letters of a credit. The creditworthiness of customers paying through CASS is assessed and monitored by IATA which runs this clearing and settlement system on behalf of the cargo carriers. Not more than 11% (2012: 12%) of the Group’s revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single customer. The five largest customers of the Group represent 42% (2012: 42%) of the net cargo sales. More than 60% (2012: 56 62%) of the Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for over four years, and losses have occurred infrequently. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or legal entity, whether they are standalone entities or part of a larger group, geographic location, aging profile, maturity and credit history. Customers that are graded as “high risk” are closely scrutinized and monitored, and future sales are made on a prepayment or collateral basis with approval of the Credit Committee. The Group’s credit risk exposure is mitigated by a credit risk insurance purchased from a professional and international insurer that retrocedes the risk to the Group’s captive reinsurance company to cover delinquent customer payments. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables (see Note 18). The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by areas was: In thousands of U.S. Dollar 2013 2012 Area I 38,987 36,802 Area II 120,684 132,949 Area III 87,283 73,949 Area IV 2,924 3,753 249, 878 247,453 Cargolux is a member of the IATA clearing systems CASS (Cargo Accounts Settlement Systems) and ICH (IATA Clearing House) commonly used by forwarders and airlines, respectively, to settle payments. In 2013, 77.57% of receivables were cleared through CASS and ICH (74.29% in 2012). As of December 31, 2013, 98.38% (98.26% in 2012) of the total outstanding trade debtors were within the contractual payment terms. The average DSO of trade receivables was 43.2 days in 2013 (42.6 days in 2012). In 2013 the Group suffered a credit loss of US$ 0.35 million (2012: US$ 0.42 million). (b) Fuel risk Fuel price The price of fuel significantly affects the Group’s earnings. At a 2013 average of USD/tonne 987, the jet market price decreased by USD/tonne 45 compared to the preceding year. Although moderate, this marks the first annual cargolux | Annual Report 2013 decline since 2009, but fuel prices remained at high levels throughout 2013. Fuel hedges To manage its fuel price risk, the Group uses derivative instruments, mainly options. The large majority of the protection is provided through call options. To reduce the premiums paid for call options, the Group sometimes combines the purchase of call options with the sale of put options, which creates a potential for the Group to pay out from such positions when the fuel price settles below the put strike price. The balance of selective downside exposure at low fuel prices and sustained protection against high fuel prices is reviewed in regular meetings of the Group’s Fuel Risk Management Committee. The Committee works within a Governance framework of Policy and Procedures and actively manages the fuel hedge portfolio. As at December 31, 2013, a quantity of 119,205 metric tonnes was hedged for the first half of 2014. For the second half of 2014, the coverage amounted to 87,417 metric tonnes. 2015 coverage stood at 35,762 metric tonnes, following the Company’s gradual approach to fuel hedging. 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements As at December 31, 2013, the fair value of fuel derivatives was as follows: In thousands of U.S. Dollar 2013 2012 Derivative assets 7,097 16,398 Derivative liabilities (181) (3,972) Balance at January 1 6,916 12,426 Non-qualifying hedges recognized in profit and loss 631 (5,510) Derivative assets 7,547 7,097 Derivative liabilities (181) Balance at December 31 7,547 6,916 None of these positions have been considered for hedge accounting in 2013. (c) Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group. Generally, the Group does not incur non-dollar denominated indebtedness to finance its assets stated in US$ in order to eliminate any related volatility in profit or loss. At the balance sheet date, the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows: In thousands of U.S. Dollar EUR HKD OTHER % of TOTAL Deposits with third parties 5,289 74 406 8.6 Trade receivables and other receivables 94,119 49,176 60,780 66.9 Cash and cash equivalents 30,326 3,941 32,352 40.8 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (32,208) 19.2 Trade payables and other payables (126,401) (2,755) (28,761) 39.7 Taxes payable (19,766) (311) 100.0 At the immediately preceding balance sheet date, the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows: In thousands of U.S. Dollar EUR HKD OTHER % of TOTAL Deposits with third parties 4,099 50 372 5.0 cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Trade receivables and other receivables 111,452 34,137 65,831 67.1 Cash and cash equivalents 27,068 8,652 16,459 49.0 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (61,690) 40.9 Trade payables and other payables (131,389) (2,099) (23,440) 38.7 Taxes payable (19,588) (424) 100.0 Relevant foreign exchange rates relative to the US$ were as follows: Average rate Reporting date spot rate 2013 2012 2013 2012 EUR 1.32813 1.28585 1.38040 1.32205 HKD 0.12892 0.12891 0.12895 0.12900 58 The Company hedges the foreign exchange risk related to receivables through the use of forwards and options. (d) Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest payments relating to its on balance sheet debt and on rental payments. Additionally, the Group is also exposed to interest rate risk related to future, non-contingent interest bearing liabilities such as financings for aircraft to be delivered outside the current reporting period. The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to increases in interest rates on borrowings is capped or reduced while allowing the Group to benefit to a certain extent from a low interest rate environment. Generally, this objective is achieved by buying caps and selling floors. This strategy is generally deemed preferable than fixing the rate at the time the loan is contracted or the payment liability is crystallized, unless at that time interest rates are deemed to be very low and in which case such rates are locked in via a swap or fixed interest loan, strategy that the Group has pursued in 2013 and is likely to continue to pursue in 2014. Where possible, the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting for those instruments in order to reduce volatility in profit or loss. At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was: In thousands of U.S. Dollar 2013 2012 Fixed rate instruments Financial liabilities 616,065 349,187 Floating rate instruments Financial assets 260,287 227,925 Financial liabilities 1,011,022 915,709 Interest rate derivatives Nominal amount of underlying financings in place at the balance sheet date 779,336 942,159 As at December 31, 2013, the fair value of interest rate derivatives was a follows: In thousands of U.S. Dollar 2013 2012 Derivative assets 18,109 18,938 Derivative liabilities (138,346) (152,897) cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Balance at January 1 (120,237) (133,959) Net change in fair value recognized in equity 40,341 13,602 Non-qualifying hedges recognized in profit and loss 735 120 Derivative assets 9,877 18,109 Derivative liabilities (89,038) (138,346) Balance at December 31 (79,161) (120,237) 59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements (e) Liquidity risk The Group’s approach to manage liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions. Major known 2014 liabilities and how the Group expects to cover same is discussed below. The Group is subject to loan covenants for some of its borrowing and finance lease arrangements, which in case of breach, unless waived, would entitle the lending parties to demand prepayment of the loan. Financial covenants require the Group to respect certain balance sheet, interest and rental coverage ratios. Under one such covenant EBITDAR (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and rentals) must cover 1.3 times net interest expense plus rentals for the period and under the second covenant the shareholders’ equity must represent at least 16.7% of total liabilities. As at December 31, 2013, the Group was in compliance with this and all other contractual financial covenants. The following are the contractual maturities of liabilities: In thousands Carrying Contracted 2014 2015 2016 Further of U.S. Dollar amount cash flows than 2016 Interest-bearing liabilities (167,923) (173,880) (63,048) (102,577) (1,377) (6,878) Finance lease liabilities (1,404,615) (1,680,774) (216,622) (166,107) (191,236) (1,106,809) Trade payables and (366,201) (369,603) (249,645) (84,988) (26,440) (8,530) other payables Derivative liabilities (89,330) (93,290) (31,487) (27,501) (16,086) (18,216) (2,028,069) (2,317,547) (560,802) (381,173) (235,139) (1,140,433) In addition to routine capital repayment under interest bearing loans, finance lease liabilities and rentals under operating leases, the Group foresees the following payments during the year immediately following the balance sheet date: • Capital expenditures relating to the acquisition of two B747-8F and related financing fees and aircraft components (approximately US$ 0.4 billion). It should be noted that the Company expects to finance those aircraft under finance lease structures. • Payment of an anti-trust fine installment of US$ 22.0 million to the Department of Justice (US DoJ). cargolux | Annual Report 2013 • US$ 94.2 million of PDPs due to Boeing in 2014 – however, as stated below, Boeing will repay to Cargolux US$ 99.7 million of PDPs. The Group will be able to meet its financial obligations in 2014 out of a mix of the proceeds of operating cash flows, PDP repayments from Boeing and the facilities mentioned below. Furthermore, the balance sheet and the liquidity of the Group are expected to be significantly strengthened by the following additional measures during 2014: • A capital increase in the amount of US$ 175 million (see note 32). • The Group is seeking final commitment from the Ex-Im Bank of the United States in May to guarantee the financing of a B747-8F to be delivered in July 2014. • The Group is currently finalizing term sheets for commercial financing covering a B747-8F scheduled for delivery in September 2014. 60 • In the first half of 2014, the Group will close a US$ 45 million refinancing for a B747-400F balloon repayment maturing in June 2014. • The Group maintains credit lines to ensure that it will be able to face its obligations when they fall due. As at December 31, 2013, the Group had the following committed credit lines (i.e. lines with respect of which the Group pays commitment fees) available for drawing: US$ 34.1 million (US$ 22.4 million and EUR 8.5 million) with a maturity ranging from May to December 2014. • To finance part of the PDPs due to Boeing in 2014 and 2015, the Group closed a new revolving PDP credit facility of US$ 37 million in January 2014. • State guaranteed credit: On December 18, 2009 the Group signed with the Luxembourg government and six financial institutions a EUR 100 million State guaranteed credit facility under the law of May 29, 2009 enabling the Government to issue its guarantee to undertakings which are temporarily affected by the crisis but are otherwise sound. On January 1, 2011, the Group reduced the credit facility by EUR 30 million and drew the EUR 70 million of the facility in December 2011. Following two repayments each of EUR 23.3 million at year-end 2012 and in 2013, the remaining outstanding of EUR 23.3 million shall be repaid at year end 2014. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 (f) Sensitivity analysis In managing currency, interest rate and fuel price risks, the Group seeks to reduce the impact of short-to-medium term changes in values on the Group’s budgeted earnings and cash flows. Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in any or all of the above would have a material impact on earnings and cash flows. For the year 2013, it is estimated that a general increase/decrease of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased/increased the Group’s profit before tax before marked-to-market of derivative instruments by approximately US$ 4.5 million. Interest rate swaps and other hedging instruments that were in place at that time have been included in this calculation. It is estimated that a general increase/decrease of one percentage point in the value of the US dollar against other foreign currencies throughout the year would have decreased/increased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately US$ 8.1 million. The forward exchange contracts and other hedging instruments that were in place at that time have been included in this calculation. The impact on the Profit and Loss of an increase in the value of the US Dollar can to a large extent be mitigated by cash inflows from currency hedging. 61 Notes to the consolidated financial statements It is estimated that an increase/decrease of USD/tonne 50 in the price of jet fuel (basis barges Rotterdam) over a one-year period would have increased/decreased the Group’s fuel bill by around US$ 46 million. The impact on the Income statement of a fuel price increase can to a large extent be mitigated by cash inflows from both fuel hedging and the fuel surcharge program.

In addition, return cost provisions on certain leased aircraft exiting the fleet in 2012 and 2013 were reviewed and resulted in a release of such provision (see also note 24). In 2012, the Group sold LX-PCV and returned LX-ZCV to the Lessor.

The Group is also subject to certain taxes in foreign tax jurisdictions in which it maintains permanent establishments. In 2008, the determination of the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the related taxable income were changed and resulted in tax losses which are amortized over a period of six years. The reassessment of investment tax credit is linked to the expiry of investment tax credits (ITC) from 2012 to 2016 which are not expected to be used due to the 2008, the 2009, the 2011 and the 2012 tax losses.

Effective January 1, 1997, the terms of the pension plan were amended for all staff who had not reached retirement age at that date. All staff who had retired at this date continue to be covered by the previous plan. Under the new schemes (covering under identical vesting rules the crews and the ground staff covered by collective work agreements and the managers), retirement benefits are generally paid in one lump sum. The rights to pension benefits commence at entry into service date and are fully vested after five years of service. The Group’s pension fund obligations (other than the liabilities with respect of the pensioners at January 1, 1997) and related assets were transferred to a life insurance company in 2002 and are held separately from the Group. The Group is current with respect of its payment obligations of the annual premiums due under the Group’s pension schemes and such premiums are expensed under Personnel costs and benefits. The Group also maintains separate insurance schemes providing for death, orphan, widow and disability benefits. These schemes are covered by an insurance plan and the related insurance premiums are reflected as a current year operating expense. The Cargolux defined benefit scheme is not a multi-employer scheme and sufficient information is available to determine the obligation, plan assets and costs to the Group. The funding requirements are determined pursuant to the projected unit funding method and the pension cost and provision have been assessed by a third party qualified actuary. The latest full pension scheme valuation was performed by the scheme’s actuaries in January 2014.

This present value was calculated using actual rental terms and a discount factor equal to Libor, respectively Euribor end-of-the-year rates. 27. Capital commitments At the balance sheet date, the Group had firm purchase orders for four B747-8F aircraft to be delivered as from 2014. These deliveries will take the total number of B747-8F in the fleet to thirteen. Based on prices published by manufacturers the total investment amount of the four B747-8Fs is close to US$ 1.4 billion. The Group constantly reviews its investment program to align it to the extent possible with the market environment. In connection with aircraft purchases, the Group routinely makes down payments to manufacturers. Such advance payments are recorded under Other property, plant and equipment or Deposits with third parties depending on whether or not the Group keeps the risks and rewards of the aircraft. 28. Contingencies Legal proceedings The Group is party to legal proceedings, both as defendant and claimant, from time to time in the normal course of its business. In addition, the Group was or is subject to investigations and proceedings from anti-trust authorities in the US, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea and Switzerland in connection cargolux | Annual Report 2013 with a worldwide investigation of air cargo carriers regarding alleged violations of anti-trust laws. While a number of proceedings have been largely completed, the Group continues to fully cooperate with all relevant authorities where necessary. The Group’s application for annulment of the EU Commission’s 2010 decision that imposed a fine of EUR 79.9 million against the Group is still pending before the EU General Court. At balance sheet date, the Group had reached settlements with and/or accepted penalties imposed by the competition authorities in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and South Korea. In the wake of the anti-trust proceedings, civil lawsuits have been launched in the US, in Canada, in England, in the Netherlands, in New Zealand, in Norway, in South Korea (filed in late November 2013, received by Cargolux in January 2014) and in Australia against a number of air carriers, including against the Group. The Group settled the class action claims in the US and in Canada in previous years. As foreseen by US procedure, some plaintiffs “opted out” of the class settlement and may individually pursue their alleged claims against the Group. After procedural 78 clarifications, some of the civil proceedings in England and in the Netherlands were resumed after having been stayed pending the decision on the application to annul the mentioned EU Commission. In 2013 and prior periods, the Group had constituted provisions to cover the Group’s exposure with respect of the anti-trust related proceedings (see also Notes 12 and 24 above). 29.

Finance and operating leases The Group entered into a lease arrangement in relation with the hangar it operates in Luxembourg. The lease con80 tains three extension options for incremental five year lease periods. This option can be exercised for the first time on the 15th anniversary of the lease, i.e. on June 15, 2024. In determining lease classification the Group evaluated whether substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership were transferred to the Group. Specifically, it was not considered as reasonably certain, at the inception of the lease, that the Group will operate the hangar beyond fifteen years. Based on this judgment, it is concluded that the lease is an operating lease. Deferred tax asset The deferred tax asset is based on the most recent business plan available at each balance sheet date. Heavy Maintenance Check The timing of “C” and “D-check” is determined in accordance with the Group’s maintenance program which is based on recommendations of the manufacturer and is approved by the civil aviation authorities (DAC). The amount provisioned is based on prices derived from contractual arrangements concluded with providers and are discounted to the balance sheet date. As of July 2009 the Group performs the major overhaul “C-checks” in-house. Provision The recognition of a provision requires that the management is in the position to make a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation resulting from past events. When no reliable estimate can be made, a contingent liability is disclosed. Residual values of aircraft Management estimate of residual values is reassessed yearly on the basis of the current and future estimated market values published by external appraisers and on the basis of observable transactions. Where appropriate this review may lead to revisions to the residual values from the current estimate. 32. Subsequent events On January 14, 2014, the State of Luxembourg selected Henan Civil Aviation and Investment Co. (HNCA) as a purchaser of its 35% stake in Cargolux. On February 13, 2014, the Group announced that it has ordered an additional B747-8F from Boeing as part of its ongoing fleet renewal and expansion program. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 On April 22, 2014, the Luxembourg State purchased 829,283 common shares representing 8.32% of the share capital of the Group and the corresponding number of mandatorily convertible bonds previously held by Luxair. On April 23, 2014, the share sale transaction, involving the purchase by HNCA from the Luxembourg State of 3,489,926 common shares representing 35% of the share capital and the voting rights in the Group, as well as 1,395,928 mandatorily convertible bonds issued by the Group, was closed. On April 23, 2014 an extraordinary general meeting of the Group’s shareholders resolved to increase the share capital by US$ 175 million in cash in exchange of newly issued common shares. The capital injection was fully paid up on the same day. 81 Report of the Réviseur d’entreprises agréé KPMG Luxembourg S.à r.l.

We are convinced that ethical corporate and individual behavior is a precondition for sustainable and profitable business relationships, fostering trust and avoiding the risk of reputational and other damage. Prevention is rooted in the Cargolux Ethics Code and Policies that form the Company’s constitutional documents. They summarize the principles that guide the Cargolux staff in doing business. Good, sustainable business is always driven by values. Cargolux’s values – dedication, respect and integrity, are also the basis for the Ethics Code. The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program was further developed in 2013. However, the project could not be concluded as foreseen due to the changes in the management setup. Except for one division, an identification of risks has been conducted and strategic objectives were defined by management – based on the business plan approved by the Board of Directors. Strategic risks will be identified in a senior management workshop and added to the key risk portfolio of the entity. The ERM will be used to manage risks and seize opportunities related to the achievement of the airline’s objectives. It incorporates the compliance program as well as a separate review of IT risks, which will be conducted in 2014. The ERM Program is another important part of the sustainable development of the Company. It aims to identify and assess risks that could adversely impact the Company’s objectives, ensures that reporting is done effectively and that the Company is compliant with rules and regulations. The ERM is developed in line with the ISO 31000 standard. Externally developed economic, environmental, and social charters, principles, or other initiatives to which the organization subscribes or endorses UN Global Compact: At Cargolux, we are committed to operating and acting in a socially and environmentally responsible manner and have underpinned this commitment in 2007 when we signed the UN Global Compact, pledging to apply its 10 key principles. UN Global Compact Foundation: cargolux | Annual Report 2013 In 2012, Cargolux became Gold contributor of the UN Global Compact Foundation. Corporate Charter for Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development: Already in 2005, Cargolux signed the Corporate Charter for Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development, an initiative launched by the Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce. ISO 14001 certification: We strive to limit the effects of our activities to the environment in the best possible way. This concerns atmospheric emissions, noise or waste materials. Cargolux demonstrated its commitment to environmentally sound operations with the ISO 14001 certification of its Flight Operations Division and Type Rating Training Organization in 2009, the Maintenance Division in 2012 and Ground Operations and Luxembourg station in 2013. SuperDrecksKëscht®: The SuperDrecksKëscht® (SDK) is a national system for enhanced waste management that is initiated by the 93 Company profile Ministry for Sustainable Development and Infrastructure in cooperation with the local communes, the Chamber of Trades, and the Chamber of Commerce. It is based on the EU waste management approach and geared towards both individuals and companies. Cargolux has been SDK certified since 2008. OHSAS 18001: An international Occupational Health and Safety management standard: To ensure the well-being of our employees, Cargolux strives to provide a working environment that is safe and healthful. To underpin this commitment to its staff, the Company had its Occupational Health and Safety management system certified according to OHSAS 18001 in 2013. Cargo2000: In 2013, the International Air Transport Association confirmed Cargolux’s Cargo 2000 platinum member status. Cargo 2000 is the name for a joint effort by a group of airlines and forwarders (members), and is, today, an IATA interest group aiming at improving the work processes in the air cargo transportation from shipper-through-to-theconsignee (end-to-end). As a platinum member, Cargolux finds itself among only nine members that have reached the highest level of the C2K classification system. Memberships in associations Cargolux is a founding member of SAFUG (Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group). We are member of IATA and a number of committees of the Association of European Airlines (AEA), for example, the Environmental Standing Committee and the Airfreight Carbon Initiative. C.3. Stakeholder engagement 4.14 |4.16 | 4.17 List of stakeholder groups engaged by the organization Stakeholder groups include our shareholders, employees, customers, investors and suppliers. They extend to the communities potentially affected by our activities, primarily living around the airport of Luxembourg, our primary operational hub, and also include government and local authorities, national and industrial representations, nongovernmental organizations and auditing bodies. Approaches to stakeholder engagement, including frequency of engagement by type and by stakeholder group cargolux | Annual Report 2013 We are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders via public meetings, direct representation or the media. Frequent and regular meetings between the senior management and the staff are a long-standing tradition at Cargolux. They are complemented by a variety of communication initiatives towards employees, including memos and newsletters. Key topics and concerns that have been raised through stakeholder engagement, and how the organization has responded to those key topics and concerns, including through its reporting 2013 was a very challenging year for Cargolux due to the difficult market conditions and the instability within the company caused by the announced change in shareholder structure. The management maintained an open dialogue with the employees who were kept informed about important 94 developments through a variety of communication channels, including the opportunity to submit questions and relay concerns to the management. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 95 Environment Disclosure on management approach It is undeniable that aviation has recognized that it must assume its responsibility in the global fight against climate change. As an operator of wide-body aircraft on long-haul flights, our flight operations activity is by far the most demanding in terms of energy consumption. It is responsible for over 99% of the CO2 emitted by the Company. Throughout the years, Cargolux has demonstrated its commitment to environmentally sound operations, the most significant commitment being the investment in a fleet of new, advanced Boeing 747-8 freighters with environmental enhancements that allow Cargolux to set new standards in sustainable airfreight transport. Cargolux is also aware of the environmental impact of its non-flight activities, and has consequently sought to obtain ISO 14001 certification of the airline’s Ground Operations and of the Luxembourg Station in 2013. Another initiative consisted in assessing the environmental commitment of general handling agents throughout the Cargolux network. A. Environmental management system The Cargolux Environmental Management System (EMS) is aligned with the requirements of the ISO 14001 certification and defines how we approach the environmental challenges that we are facing. In the context of the EMS, we define long-term goals and key performance indicators (KPI) to reduce the ecological footprint steadily, and we monitor the impact of our operations and processes on the environment. The EMS also offers significant benefits in terms of energy savings, waste reduction, process efficiency improvements and better use of limited resources. Environmental targets and objectives are implemented, maintained and documented throughout the organization and include the reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, lower noise emissions and an improved waste management in offices and workshops. We have established a variety of programs to achieve long-term objectives. An Environment Management Board (EMB) was created to coordinate all relevant efforts within the Company. It is made up of 10 members, each representing one of Cargolux’s divisions, and meets regularly to review progress on current projects while defining future action plans. The EMB is sponsored by the Chief Executive Officer and coordinated by the environmental management of Cargolux. To safeguard its continuing suitability and effectiveness, the EMS is subject to regular reviews by executive and senior management who analyze the outcome of internal audits, evaluate compliance with legal requirements and assess attained results against environmental KPI. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 a. ISO 14001 certification EN5 | EN18 | EN28 Cargolux took a further step toward earning ISO 14001 registration with the certification of Ground Operations and the Luxembourg Station in 2013. The Flight Operations Division and its Type Rating Training Organization as well as the Maintenance and Engineering division successfully passed subsequent audits during the reporting period. Cargolux initiated its environmental certification process with the Flight Operations division, in other words, its core activity, which has by far the greatest impact on the environment and where the greatest benefits are to be gained from an efficient environmental management system. Environmental awareness training Cargolux staff 96 Mandatory web-based trainings on environmental awareness are part of the corporate training curriculum as we aim to instill environmental awareness and practices into our regular business operations. Staff that is exposed to environmental issues during the performance of their job duties is encouraged to attend further internal and external training courses in order to improve their environmental expertise. New employees are introduced to the Cargolux environmental principles during their induction training. Suppliers In addition, Cargolux’s main suppliers and contractors in Maintenance and Engineering are also introduced to the Cargolux environmental principles and the environmental management system, encouraging them to actively support and contribute to the Company’s efforts towards environmental sustainability. b. Cargolux stations We continually strive to move beyond past achievement in environmental conservation and social responsibility and therefore strongly encourage our commercial and operational partners throughout the Cargolux network to endorse the Company’s principles in this field and to adhere to officially recognized environmental management standards. A survey conducted in 2013 amongst the general handling agents (GHAs) throughout the Cargolux network showed that the subject ranks high on their agenda. 57% of the GHAs advised that they have an environmental policy in place and nearly half of the stations have an environmental training in place for its staff. 23% are certified to ISO 14001 standards a ratio that we expect to increase in the future. c. Spills at the maintenance hangar EN23 No spills were recorded in 2013. B. Greenhouse gas emissions EN29 B.1.Flight Operations IATA, the International Air Transport Association, has defined long and near-term targets for airlines to reduce CO2 emissions and to eventually achieve carbon-neutral growth: cargolux | Annual Report 2013 • A cap on aviation CO2 emissions from 2020 (carbon neutral growth) • An average improvement in fuel efficiency of 1,5% per year from 2009 to 2020 • A reduction in CO2 emissions of 50% by 2050, relative to 2005 levels The Company has developed a framework of voluntary actions to meet these targets and has made significant investments to operate one of the most fuel-efficient fleets available on the market. Fuel and CO2 emissions performance EN3 | EN16 In 2013, Cargolux aircraft emitted on average 159 grams of fuel for each tonne transported over 1 km, which corresponds to 501 grams of CO2 emissions per tonne-km. This almost 4% reduction over 2012 clearly underlines our commitment to meet IATA’s annual 1.5% fuel efficiency improvement target for the period from 2009 to 2020. A further improvement of the CO2 emissions is expected as of 2014, when we take delivery of 2 further 747-8 freighters powered with the performance improvement package (PIP) version of the GEnx engines. 97 Environment 2013 2012 2011 Variation (%) CO2 emissions (in million tonnes) 2.86 2.49 2.72 14.9 CO2 emissions (in g/tkm) 501 520 540 -3.7 Fuel burn per tkm (in g/tkm) 159 165 171 -3.6 a. Regulatory compliance EU Emissions Trading scheme (ETS) Cargolux continued to comply with the full EU-ETS reporting and maintained the original set-up of monitoring, reporting and verifying the emissions processes. In the fall of 2013, the ICAO assembly agreed to develop a global market-based measure (global ‘MBM’) to limit CO2 emissions of international aviation. La Loi Grenelle II A new law entered into force in France in 2013, obliging logistics and transport companies to disclose the CO2 emissions for every shipment departing from or destined for France. Cargolux is fully compliant with the Grenelle requirements. b. Voluntary actions APU EN5 | EN18 In 2013, the hours of APU use increased by 21.4% compared to the year before. This is in particular due to an increased number of aircraft operated, but also to a higher number of flights carrying temperature-sensitive cargo such as pharmaceuticals and life science products, live animals and perishable goods. This delicate type of cargo requires a seamless temperature-controlled infrastructure to preserve their quality and integrity across their global supply chains. 2013 2012 2011 Variation (%) Hours of APU use 30,957 25,500 23,592 21.4 cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Number of cycles 17,493 14,702 13,718 19.0 Average time per cycle (minutes) 106 104 103.19 2.9 Number of aircraft 20 17 15 Hours of APU use / aircraft 1,547.9 1,500 1,572.8 0.9 The Auxiliary Power Unit, APU, is a small turbine providing power to run electrical systems when no ground power supply is available. It also provides pneumatic power for engine starts and runs the air conditioning systems. Network optimization and flexibility EN5 | EN18 The high level of flexibility of our operations greatly helped the Company to overcome the difficult market conditions that prevailed in 2013. The flawless cooperation between the commercial, operations and maintenance divisions 98 enabled us to consolidate and re-route flights in order to achieve an optimum balance between revenue generation and cost optimization, including the minimization of fuel usage and reduction of CO2 emissions. Ongoing programs • Deep core engine washing EN5 | EN18 | EN26 • Fleet renewal program • Alternative fuels c. Suppliers Trucking EN5 | EN18 Cargolux complements its flights and facilitates the transfer of goods between production or distribution centers and airports with road feeder services. The Company emphasizes working with companies that operate modern trucks conforming to the latest standards. In Europe, where the majority of all trucking activities organized by Cargolux take place, 89% of the sub-contracted companies operate trucks complying with emission class Euro 5 or Euro 6, which is the highest standard currently applicable. Trucking is also organized in North America and Asia. In total, 435 vehicles were regularly used to transport goods on behalf of Cargolux during the reporting period. Air cargo trucking is a premium product on the road transport market and operators need the reliability and efficiency of newer vehicles, with the result that younger fleets are operated as part of our service offering. 2013 % 2012 % 2011 % 2010 % EURO 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 EURO 3 25 6 40 11 87 23 99 24 EURO 4 20 5 20 5 20 5 59 14 EURO 5 275 63 270 71 266 69 254 62 EURO 6 115 26 50 13 10 3 0 0 TOTAL 435 100 380 100 383 100 412 100 B.2. Luxembourg headquarters As a cargo airline operating wide-body aircraft on long-haul flights, we mainly impact the environment through atmospheric emissions, notably CO2, resulting from our fuel consumption. However, we commit to the sustainable management of finite resources as a rule by reducing the impact of CO2 emissions of non-flight activities, including cargolux | Annual Report 2013 road feeder services, the ground support equipment fleet, business travel, commuting and office heating. Facilities EN3 | EN4 | EN6 In line with this target, all electricity consumed by Cargolux in Luxembourg is provided from 100% renewable hydroelectric sources. To further reduce electricity consumption at the Cargolux Maintenance Center, electricity counters were installed in different locations of the building to capture detailed data on consumption throughout the year. The results will be available at the end of 2014. Ground support equipment EN3 | EN16 The ground support equipment fleet consumed a total of 97,124 liters of fuel in 2013, representing 257 tonnes of CO2 emissions. 99 Environment Type of fuel Liters Industrial fuel 75,406 Diesel 17,452 Unleaded gasoline 95 4,266 C. Noise emissions The emission of noise is the second important area of environmental concern to Cargolux after CO2 emissions and all possible efforts are made to mitigate the amount of noise produced by our aircraft. These efforts are of particular importance at the Company’s hub in Luxembourg, as this is where the highest number of aircraft movements takes place. D. Material and waste Paper and cartridges EN1 Paper use at HQ in Luxembourg Variation (in %) 2013 2012 2011 Paper (tonnes) -3,7 29.24 30.36 33.21 Cartridge (pcs) 3,3 247 239 349 Less paper on flight decks EN1 At the end of the reporting period, Cargolux was ready for a mostly paperless operation on both aircraft types, the 747-400F and 747-8F. All Cargolux aircraft and its two simulators were equipped with Class 3 Electronic Flight Bags (EFB), a digital information management system installed on the flight deck, hosting applications for take-off and landing performance calculations, operations manuals, navigational charts and several pilot utilities. Further to the EFB, the traditional printed manuals for the personal use of flight crews were replaced with iPads. All information previously available in printed manuals is now stored on the tablet, cutting down the printing of cargolux | Annual Report 2013 manuals by 75%. Waste management EN22 Cargolux has a waste management system in place which is run by a specialized company. This company manages and monitors the proper segregation, collection, processing and disposal of all waste categories, including recyclable waste and hazardous products. All Luxembourg-based facilities and offices, including rented offices, are covered by the waste-sorting and recycling system. Waste Management is included in the web-based environmental awareness training that is mandatory for all staff every three years. 100 In recognition of our continued efforts in the area of waste management, Cargolux was awarded Luxembourg’s environmental SDK label, “SuperDrecksKëscht® for Companies”, for the fifth consecutive time. The SDK label is a program run by Luxembourg’s Ministry for Sustainable Development and Infrastructure. It is awarded to companies that implement the label’s environmental concept and can demonstrate this by means of material flow balances. The label is certified according to international norm DIN EN ISO 14024. Waste disposal Variation 13/12 in % 2013 2012 2011 by category (in kg) Hazardous waste -18.0 144,615 176,544 128,959 Recyclable waste -21.9 91,037 116,639 103,383 Residual waste -27.2 56,836 78,128 87,696 Oily waste -4.9 21,664 23,836 24,998 Other waste 56.7 6,879 4,390 5,888 Compared to 2012, Cargolux produced smaller quantities of waste in all categories, with the exception of the ‘other waste’ category, that mainly comprises end-of-life tires and polystyrene. The difference of waste produced during the reporting period is due to the fact that in 2013, we saw less hangar maintenance man-hours than the year before, which is a consequence of the fleet renewal program. % 16 Metal 1 Plastic 32 Paper 5 Dangerous 21Wood 1 Glass 24 Biodegradable E. Water EN8 The water consumption increased during the reporting period to 8,639 m3, out of which 1,371 m3 was used for aircraft washing. This represents an increase of 19% over 2012. This amount includes the usage at the maintenance cargolux | Annual Report 2013 facility and the headquarters. Other rented offices in Luxembourg and stations are not recorded. In 2012, additional water meters were installed at the maintenance hangar that will deliver improved data on the water consumption and potential water savings. First results are expected at the end of 2014. 101 Social Disclosure on management approach Despite the economic turbulences that affected the cargo community in 2013 and the internal challenges that would threaten the sustainability of many companies, Cargolux managed to maintain its course and did not forget its commitment to social responsibilities. Banking on our core values of dedication, respect and integrity, we pulled together as a team and made cultural and social diversity a high priority in our business dealings. We not only respect human rights and dignity in our areas of operation, but also comply with all relevant national laws. We try to answer calls for help whenever possible and support non-governmental organizations, promote sports and cultural activities. We believe that a healthy and safe workplace for our employees and the smallest possible impact of our operations on the environment is of utmost importance and one of the main pillars of our success. A. Business ethics and compliance Cargolux has a comprehensive compliance program in place, which aims at safeguarding the Company’s business and protecting its employees by enabling them to better identify ethical challenges and giving them the tools to handle these adequately. We are firmly committed to fostering an ethical business culture that promotes compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as adherence to internal rules and policies. A.1. Training HR3 Cargolux has implemented a compliance training program for all employees, GSAs and legal representatives, composed of class-room and online training on anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-competitive behavior. In 2013, a two-year refresher program of the ‘Ethics Code and Policies’ training course was started and will be terminated in 2014. This workshop covers a variety of topics, including anti-bribery, anti-trust, purchasing, business partners, expense reports, confidential information, conflict of interest, gift and entertainment, as well as export controls. GSAs, Cargolux staff on stations throughout the world, Sales & Marketing and Finance were enrolled in online traincargolux | Annual Report 2013 ing courses covering fair competition and anti-bribery. Crew members were invited to complete an ‘Ethics code & new policies training course for Cargolux crew members’. At the end of the reporting period, 532 individuals from our worldwide network had completed over 1,689 hours of compliance training. A.2. Communication The Company has developed an internal communication program for compliance, aimed at enhancing awareness and keeping employees informed about relevant developments in this field. The program includes a dedicated newsletter and Intranet page. A survey conducted in 2013 amongst non-managerial staff in Luxembourg and employees of European and Mid102 dle-East stations, designed to identify the perception of compliance in general and the compliance program at Cargolux, showed that compliance is recognized as an important element of our business and that the staff is committed to the Company’s program. A.3. Risk analysis Cargolux regularly analyzes business partners and suppliers for risk related to corruption. Due diligence is performed on business partners classified at high and medium risk. The risk classification is country-specific (Corruption Perception Index) and based on the type of service rendered. B. Our employees LA1 Although 2013 proved to be another difficult year for Cargolux, the Group achieved a net profit of USD 8.4 million, not least due to the continued support and engagement of all staff. Despite higher business activities, translating into an increase of 13,364 block hours compared to budget, we maintained a conservative approach as far as human resources management was concerned. The total number of employees worldwide went up by 3%, from 1,559 in 2012 to 1,606 in 2013. New hires LA2 Headquarters Rest of the world Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female New hires 125 86 39 67 54 13 58 32 26 Below 30 years 65 41 24 32 24 8 33 17 16 30-50 years 60 45 15 35 30 5 25 15 10 Over 50 years 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Staff Turnover LA2 A staff turnover rate of only 2.4% in 2013 confirmed the continued loyalty of employees towards the company. The average staff seniority is more than 12 years.

We believe that such diversity is an asset that contributes to our success. The 1,224 employees in Luxembourg alone represented as many as 34 different nationalities, while the entire workforce of 1,606 individuals was composed of 54 nationalities. This is an important element that greatly helps the Company to understand and adapt to cultures and customs throughout the world. With merely 20% of the employees being female, Cargolux is clearly a male-dominated company. This gender gap is caused by the fact that our two largest groups of employees, aircraft mechanics and pilots, are professions that are known to predominantly attract men. However, we actively encourage women to apply for these positions. 2 out of 13 members of the Company’s Board of Directors are female. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 We have defined no minority groups, as no difference is made between the staff. Parental leave LA15 In 2013, 22 employees – out of a total 231 eligible staff went on parental leave, 8 women (25 eligible) and 14 men (206 eligible), one of which did not return. The high number of eligible employees is due to the fact that, in Luxembourg, parents have the possibility to take parental leave up to their child’s fifth birthday. Also, we assume that new hires took advantage of this benefit prior to joining Cargolux. 104 B.1. Employee relations It is common practice on the part of management to maintain an open dialogue with the trade unions, the staff representatives and the staff directly. Collective Bargaining Agreement LA4 A majority of our employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective work agreements (CWA). In 2013, 88% of the staff at the headquarters in Luxembourg fell under the CWA regime. 2013 2012 2011 Staff covered by collective work agreement (Luxembourg) 88.0% 88.0% 87.7% Staff with a permanent contract (Luxembourg) 97.3% 99.7% 98.5% Joint Works Council Employees working at the headquarters are represented by a staff delegation, whose function is predominantly one of protecting the rights of employees, and a joint works council (‘Comité Mixte’) that is composed of staff and employer representatives in equal numbers and enjoys co-determination rights on Company policy in a wide field of topics, including recruitment, promotion, transfer and dismissal, employee assessment and health and safety matters. In addition, the Joint Works Council possesses consultation and information rights relative to management decisions pertaining to technical changes, training and the Company’s economic and financial situation, to name but a few. Besides, pilot representatives are in charge of social dialogue with Company management on crew-related matters. B.2. Helping first-time job seekers Cargolux continues to actively support two types of measures sponsored by the Employment Administration (ADEM) that were adopted by the Luxembourg Government with the intention to promote employment prospects on the job market. The employment initiation contract (‘contract d’initiation à l’emploi’, CIE) is designed to enable such job seekers to receive practical training during work hours in order to make them better suited for the labor market. Targeting young graduates who encounter difficulties finding a job, the practice-oriented employment initiation contract (‘contrat d’initiation à l’emploi – expérience pratique’, CIE-EP) offers them practical work experience in order to facilitate their entry into the professional life. At the end of the reporting period, Cargolux employed 16 people under the CIE regime. This initiative not only supports young first-time job seekers, but it also allows the Company to absorb increasing workload. B.3. Training LA10 cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Training is an important element for the day-to-day functioning of Cargolux. Flight Crews and Maintenance staff regularly attend courses on the use of new equipment, technologies or the application of new procedure and to maintain and upgrade their license. Similarly, training courses for Ground Operations staff are essential for them to be qualified to perform certain functions, such as supervising the loading of an aircraft. These types of training are an essential means of ensuring operational flight safety; a field where no compromise can be made. Cargolux also offers its staff a wide range of training opportunities that allows to enhance skills, capabilities and knowledge, as it enables us to operate safely and efficiently and sustain our success in an increasingly competitive industry. In 2013, each employee received on average 45 hours of training, out of which about 6 hours were non-compulsory. Flight Crew training: 2013 was another busy year for Flight Crew training with a total number of 27,762 hours of training provided to Cargolux flight crews. This is an increase of 30% over the previous reporting period, or 14 hours per flight crew. 105 Social Technical training: The Technical Training department has reviewed and streamlined its training curriculum, whereby training courses were merged and classroom courses were converted into e-learning modules. As a consequence, the number of courses went up by roughly 32%, whilst the training hours given by the department where reduced by 25% compared to the year before. The Technical Training department trained a total of 924 individuals in 2013, 454 out of which were non-Cargolux. Ground Operations training: In 2013, the Ground Operations training department provided 16,224 hours of training to Cargolux staff, GHAs, GSAs and shippers. The increase of 19% compared to the previous year is due to the additional stations that were opened in 2013. Compliance: At the end of the reporting period, 532 individuals from our worldwide network had completed over 1,689 hours of compliance training. B.4. Occupational Health and Safety Cargolux is fully committed to protecting and preserving the health, safety and welfare of our employees, our most precious asset. Particular attention is paid to our maintenance and ground operations staff that tends to be more exposed to potentially dangerous situations, be it because they use specific machinery or equipment, handle hazardous substances or work close to the aircraft. OHSAS 18001 certification In 2013, the Maintenance & Engineering (M&E) division successfully passed the external audit for the OHSAS 18001 certification. OHSAS 18001 stands for Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Specification and is the international assessment specification for occupational health and safety management systems that develops a systematic management approach to occupational health and safety (OHS) issues. This certification enhances the protection of M&E staff, contractors and suppliers working at the maintenance hangar, production shops and offices. It will give Cargolux a framework to identify, control and reduce the risks that cargolux | Annual Report 2013 are typically associated with health and safety in our workplace. The risk areas within the Company will be certified progressively over the years to come. Training The OHS curriculum was developed and two new courses were added to the program. Injuries at Luxembourg headquarters LA7 Accidents involving Cargolux employees, both at work (internal) and on their way to/from work (external), remained at low levels. Our statistics show that the percentage of internal accidents compared to the total number of employees is less than 3%, which compares favorably to other industrial sites. 106 Number of injuries 2013 2012 Internal 33 29 External 15 14 Total 48 43 Injury rate 2013 2012 Cargolux 4.4 3.9 Lost days 2013 2012 Accidents 505.9 312.3 Sickness 13,745.8 10,398.1 Noise reduction Noise is a critical factor in aviation maintenance and can cause health problems to the staff. To mitigate the potential danger for our employees, the noise reduction project, launched in 2012, was continued in 2013. In order to reduce the noise level at the maintenance hangar, an area for noise intensive tasks, such as riveting big aircraft parts, was designated and equipped with professional insulation material. For remaining high noise level tasks a noise warning system was taken into operation to warn concerned staff in order to allow the staff to protect themselves accordingly. The noise awareness campaign including e-learning modules, posters and information booklets was prolonged throughout the year. H&S topics covered in formal agreements with trade unions LA9 cargolux | Annual Report 2013 OHS-related matters are covered in the CWA between Cargolux and the concerned unions. Four members of the staff delegation hold a special OHS role including the full time safety delegate. The CWA stipulates the set-up of a joint management-employee OHS committee and the participation of staff representatives in health and safety inspections, audits and accident investigations. The purpose of this body is essentially to promote and maintain an active interest in OHS on the part of the involved parties in order to avoid accidents and occupational illness, suggest improvements and follow-up on their implementation. 107 Community A. Participation in education A.1. Aircraft Maintenance License (AML) apprentice scheme In 2013, seven students successfully passed their exam to become licensed AML aircraft mechanics, four of which obtained a B-license and three an A-license. Graduates from Luxembourg’s AML apprentice scheme obtain a license in accordance with EASA regulations, Part 66. After having obtained the AML, the junior mechanics will have to complete a type rating training for the 747-400 and 747-8 aircraft in-house, in order to be fully licensed to work on Cargolux aircraft. The aircraft mechanics apprenticeship program is run in partnership with a local technical high school, the Lycée Technique Privée Emile Metz. Cargolux accepted three apprentices for the two-year B-license program in 2013. A.2. Support to youth and schools Given the increasingly difficult situation on the labor market for job starters, young people in Luxembourg have a range of possibilities to get an insight into the working life and to learn about the opportunities and requirements for a career in various sectors. Cargolux actively supports a number of these initiatives by means of tailor-made company visits and trainings in various departments going from a few days to several months. Such practical experience proves useful in guiding the career choice of young people as they get a glimpse into the specificities of the cargo industry and a host of general professions. In 2013, we were involved in a number of initiatives, including Day Care, an initiative led by the Luxembourg arm of the CARE in Luxembourg. Students taking part in the project have the possibility to spend a day at a company of their choice and become familiar with certain aspects of the work life. Participating companies pay a token salary for every student participant that is donated for vocational training at the world’s largest refugee camp in Kenya. Another initiative was the Girls’ Day, which has been on our agenda for many years. Participating companies present profiles of professions that are usually not held by women. Each year, Cargolux invites a group of young girls to discover jobs in aviation, as the air cargo industry is still a male-dominated activity. B. Supporting non-governmental organizations cargolux | Annual Report 2013 Flying for help As an all-cargo airline operating long-haul flights, Cargolux has the great opportunity to support local and international charity organizations with free-of-charge or stand-by-basis transports to any destination within our worldwide network. This kind of support can be crucial to the success of a project as transportation fees usually form a substantial part of the cost of a project. During the reporting period, Cargolux supported four projects by non-governmental organization, primarily in Africa. On a larger scale, the Company responded to the devastating typhoon Haiyan on the Philippines by operating three relief flights to Manila in help of the victims. 108 In 2013, Cargolux also continued its long-standing support of the International Bazaar, one of Luxembourg’s biggest annual charity events. It brings together volunteers from nearly 60 nations to sell goods and specialties from their home countries. The funds raised are distributed among a wide number of larger and smaller aid and relief projects throughout the world. In 2013, Cargolux supported the stands of the United States, Hungary, South Africa and China. Cargolux employees helping to help Cargolux employees have traditionally shown great commitment to charitable initiatives. In 2013, the devastating typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines triggered a spontaneous show of solidarity. On very short notice, Cargolux employees, relatives and friends collected a total of nearly 28 tonnes of clothes and relief goods for the three flights operated to Manila. The After-Work Swimming fundraiser event by the International Section of the Luxembourg Red Cross was another initiative that was supported by Cargolux and its personnel. For the second time, a Cargolux team of employees and their families successfully competed against local companies to collect money at the benefit of the Red Cross’s Social Groceries. Cargolux and its staff also supported the charity program Gift for Kids. Organized by the American Women’s Club of Luxembourg, Gift for Kids aims to deliver presents for St. Nicholas Day on December 6th to children and youngsters living in care homes in Luxembourg. Companies taking part in the initiative host trees decorated with ornaments containing the child’s name, the age and gift wish. Employees selected ornaments and paid for their gifts. Altogether more than 20 companies and schools in Luxembourg supported the program, making it possible that about 600 children and youngsters received a St. Nicolas gift in early December. C. Supporting the arts and culture The support of arts and culture is equally important to the Company as the support of charity organizations. In 2013, Cargolux carried three such shipments, in addition to eight shipments that were moved in the context of a partnership agreement with the Museum of Modern Arts (MUDAM). The Company extended its sponsorship agreement with the MUDAM for another three years, starting in January 2014. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 109 Customer care Cargolux can build its success on the trust of its customers, a trust that has led to many long-lasting partnerships. Our customers rely on the proven Cargolux quality to ensure the satisfaction of their own clients and we work hard every day, not only to keep up this high quality level but also to maintain the loyalty of our partners. The result of these efforts is exemplified in the numerous awards that Cargolux has received throughout the years; we are proud and humbled that the industry repeatedly honors and shows its satisfaction with our services. Cargo 2000 (C2K) platinum membership status In 2013, the International Air Transport Association confirmed Cargolux’s Cargo 2000 platinum member status. Cargo 2000 is the name for a joint effort by a group of airlines and forwarders (members) and is, today, an IATA interest group aiming at improving the work processes in the air cargo transportation from the shipper through to the consignee (end-to-end). As a platinum member, Cargolux finds itself among only nine members that have reached the highest level of the C2K classification system. Improved service First GDP certified airline At the end of the year 2013, the Cargolux management system was attested to meet the requirements of the EU directive ‘Guidelines on Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use’ and of WHO guidelines and was consequently the first airline worldwide to be granted Good Distribution Practice (GDP) status in early 2014. This certification underlines Cargolux’s strong commitment to the safe and expedient movement of high-value temperature-sensitive healthcare shipments across its global network. Cargolux’s DGR Awareness Award To emphasize the importance of careful and proper Dangerous Goods (DGR) handling and to recognize the particular efforts of ground handling partners who demonstrate a high level of awareness and diligence with regard to the handling of DGR in their daily work, Cargolux recognized ground service company ‘LUG aircargo handling’ at Frankfurt airport with the DGR Awareness Award in appreciation of the keen efforts of the LUG DGR team in the area of DGR compliance, handling and reporting. cargolux | Annual Report 2013 110 cargolux | Annual Report 2013 111 GRI table 2013 Description Explanation Reporting level Page 1.
