The mittens were introduced as a uniting symbol of patriotism that Canadians could wear as they cheered for our nation’s athletes, and served as a fundraiser to support Olympians in their quest to reach the podium. When the Winter Olympics finally took place in Vancouver in February 2010, the mittens had become one of the most recognized, and coveted, items of the Games. Subsequently, HBC has introduced a new ‘red mitten’ design each year, raising more than $22 million for Canadian athletes since launch. With more than 5 million pairs sold, the mittens have become a staple in winter wardrobes and an iconic symbol of Canadian pride. Hudson’s Bay’s continued support of the Canadian Olympic Team has afforded Olympians, like me, the opportunity to realize their dreams. In addition to the work, determination and demanding schedule, the journey to the Olympics obviously requires resources and funding. The $22 million raised for Canadian athletes through Hudson’s Bay’s Red Mitten Program gave me that much-needed helping hand to reach the podium in Vancouver and Sochi. – Alex Bilodeau, 2-time Olympic Gold Medalist, Freestyle Skiing – Mogul H u d s o n ’ s B ay C o m pa n y 2013 C S R R e p o r t 7 corporate investing in contributing ethical sourcing engaging Reporting overview our community to a sustainable standards our people parameters environment i n v e s ti n g i n o u r c o m m u n it y h a bitat f o r “We are grateful for Home Outfitters and HBC h u m a n it y c a n a d a Foundation’s continued support of Habitat through programs like ‘Build a Dream Home’,” said Kevin Marshman, President & CEO of Habitat for Humanity Canada. “It’s because of donors like Home Outfitters that we’re able to continue reaching new highs in the number of low-income families we serve each year.” d re s s “Our clients require professional attire to help f o r s u cce s s them transition from unemployment to economic independence,” said Paige Souter, Executive Director, Dress for Success Toronto. “Through the HBC Foundation’s donation of quality, professional accessories, we are able to directly help prepare and empower 400 individuals who are working to transform their lives.

Issues discovered of audited factories did not meet HBC’s social compliance standards included inadequate emergency exits, missing electrical panel covers, and were therefore not approved to do business with HBC. inadequate sprinkler systems and limited numbers of fire extinguishers. Training is executed by analyzing the issues found in the audit, identifiying priorities and then establishing the right materials/curriculum. In 2013 we worked with partners to conduct fire safety training workshops, and saw immediate improvements in these factories. Through a shared commitment to remediation by retailers, vendors and factories, we have sustained progress in reducing the number of violations in these areas, thereby contributing to a safer work environment. Seventy-one per cent of HBC’s factories received an “Approved for Production Subject to Improvement” grade in 2013, up from 68 per cent the year prior. This grade is given to factories where more than one issue has been identified and require immediate attention from both the factory and HBC to work together to resolve. Factories receiving this grade work toward full remediation by following guidelines put forth in their Corrective Action Plan and by participating in recommended training programs. The increase in the number of factories receiving a “Subject to Improvement” grade is the result of a revised audit methodology implemented in early 2013.

Our commitment to ethical sourcing stems from a comprehensive understanding of the importance of ethical sourcing practices in all areas of the business, from the sourcing of private-branded merchandise to the selection of our assortment of internationally recognized national brands. Ethical sourcing decisions start with the initial exchange between a buyer and a vendor. To improve our merchants’ understanding of social compliance as it relates to their business, we conduct information sessions, highlighting changes to our program policies and global human rights issues. The increased level of communication between our social compliance teams and merchant teams leads to greater program support and a collective effort to support and sustain an ethical supply chain.

Following the tragic Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in 2013, HBC partnered with 16 other retail industry leaders to form the Global Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. This legally binding and results-oriented initiative is dedicated to driving positive change in Bangladesh’s Ready-Made Garment sector. Through collaborative efforts, the Alliance has implemented robust inspection standards, developed worker empowerment committees and embraced a commitment to improve the health and safety conditions in factories supplying Alliance member stores. The Alliance believes in a shared responsibility between factory owners, factory managers and retailers to create and sustain safe and healthy workplaces. Alliance members have committed to achieve audit inspections for 100 per cent of Alliance factories within the first year of operation. The completion of a factory worker survey provided the Alliance with a deeper understanding of the challenges encountered in managing factories in Bangladesh. This allowed the Alliance to tailor its training and remediation programs to increase competencies in core areas such as building and fire safety and worker empowerment. HBC is committed to working as part of the Global Alliance to prevent future tragedies and promote positive change in Bangladesh’s Ready-Made Garment sector.

The program is designed to help improve working conditions and increase productivity in Cambodia’s factories. BFC has implemented training tools to support factory remediation plans. Course offerings are extensive and include Workplace Cooperation workshops, Occupational Health and Safety training, and Workers’ Rights and Responsibilities training. HBC encourages its factories to participate and engage in these training programs to maximize the potential for improved overall wellbeing of factory workers in Cambodia.

In an effort to increase transparency in our industry, beginning in 2014, HBC began disclosing a list of factories used to produce HBC’s private branded merchandise. This list is published on HBC’s corporate website and includes the names and addresses of these factories. The factory list will be updated regularly as HBC continues to build and support a sustainable vendor base.

HERproject is a leading collaborative effort that empowers low-income women at work by providing them with education and training. It also empowers women working in global supply chains through workplace-based programs, capacity building of local civil society, and advocacy with business and government. To date, the program has reached more than 250,000 low-income women workers, of whom 80 per cent report influencing others, leading to approximately one million beneficiaries. We partnered with a garment factory in Guangdong, China to participate in an initiative now referred to as HERhealth. HERhealth workplace programs strive to improve awareness and behavior related to general and reproductive health by challenging harmful taboos, promoting preventive care, and increasing access to critical health products and services. The program operates through a peer-to-peer model, whereby a group of women in each factory is selected to be peer health educators who are provided with training. A kick-off meeting to introduce factory workers to the program took place in November 2013. The factory then formed an internal team on January 21, 2014 and participated in training conducted by Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) in China. At time of writing the factory is in the process of developing training materials for its first peer health educators with a projected completion date of summer 2014. Through this partnership with one key vendor factory, we hope HERproject will provide a sustainable impact on women’s health and the overall well-being of factory workers. We plan to continue our participation with HERproject in 2014 and work with key factories in other countries.

Associate input is integral to our plan to develop a roadmap for shaping and maintaining our culture over time. Through shared values, a sense of personal ownership and commitment to open and ongoing communication, HBC is committed to a culture that will drive Associate engagement and business performance to ensure our future success.
