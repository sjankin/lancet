Development of the plan involved about six months of in-depth discussions on the direction JAL should take to establish a high-profit structure aimed at fully regaining stakeholder confidence, continue providing the best service for customers and serve reliably as a company that contributes significantly to society. Our primary objective was to create a plan that every employee could understand and act upon. Maintaining safe operations and providing the best service for our customers require the complete alignment of all employees toward the same goal as we “pass the baton,” regardless of their individual worksites. We began by studying the JAL Philosophy and bringing in the divisional profitability management system to unite all 32,000 Group employees as one team so that we could quickly, effectively and accurately respond to the changing business environment and any challenges that may arise. Since the plan’s announcement, our business environment has in fact been subject to significant change, including a further weakening of the yen, rising fuel prices and escalating competition due to an increase in the number of departure and arrival slots in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Nevertheless, thanks to the patronage of our many customers as well as public support, we were able to build on our efforts with employees and enter into the third year of the plan without having to change our three management targets: maintaining the highest standard of safety, Customer Satisfaction No. 1, and operating profit margin of 10% or more and equity ratio of 50% or more in FY2016. Our projections for the current fiscal year anticipate lower earnings on higher revenues for the third consecutive year, reflecting severe operating conditions. This year will be a time of preparation for achieving higher earnings on higher revenues starting with next fiscal year, and we intend to face each challenge, united with our employees as a single team. We look forward to your continued patronage and support as we advance toward our goal of becoming the most preferred airline in the world.

We believe it is important to sufficiently review the progress and achievements of the Medium Term Management Plan, analyze and review the results, identify measures that need to be improved, and explain the status of this process and future concerns to our staff, customers, shareholders and all other stakeholders.

A period for achieving management targets steadily FY 2014 and preparing for new growth We have faced a more severe business environment caused by rising fuel costs due to the weaker yen, negative effects to traffic demand caused by the consumption tax hike, and intensifying competition at Tokyo metropolitan airports as a result of the dramatic increase of international flight slots at Haneda Airport. In future, as a unique challenge of the JAL Group, we must survive the competition under the condition that fewer than expected international slots at Haneda Airport were allocated to the JAL Group. We will take on the challenge of providing the finest products and services to deliver a passenger experience that is satisfying and refreshing on Narita routes, where we compete head on with other airline routes departing from Haneda, in addition to maintaining revenue from our existing routes. FY2014 will therefore be a year of establishing a firm business foundation to achieve FY2015 growth based on improvements in revenue and profit. A period for achieving management targets in the FY 2015– FY2016 Medium Term Management Plan and starting new growth Although we expect a severe business environment ahead, we are not only pursuing business expansion; we are also working to differentiate ourselves in order to survive the competition based on the keywords “Autonomy,” “Challenge” and “Speed.” We will survive the competition through strengthening our cost competitiveness and increasing convenience by enhancing the JAL Brand and improving products and services for the many customers who choose the JAL Group over other airlines. In doing so, we will accomplish growth in terms of revenue and profit improvement.

Column Emergency Aid for the Central Philippines Affected by Typhoon Haiyan As an airline company that bridges Japan with the world as well as the various regions of Japan, JAL extends emergency aid that only an airline can provide at times of major disaster. In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan caused catastrophic damage to the central Philippines. Following the Japanese government’s decision to dispatch a disaster relief team from the Japan International Cooperation Agency, JAL operated an emergency charter flight within 23 hours of the request. At Manila Airport, Filipino staff hoping to serve at a time of national calamity helped the Japanese relief team unload and load their relief supplies so that the group could quickly transfer to an aircraft bound for the affected area of the country. Our staff also raised a banner inside the airport expressing our sympathy and support as well as encouragement for the people whose lives had been affected. JAL cooperated with the Japan Platform, an NGO network, by offering free air transport for eight NGO staff members participating in the relief effort and 11 tons of relief goods and supplies. We also provided support through a JAL Charity Mileage campaign and made a donation from the Group as well as individual contributions from employees.

Response to the Third-Party Opinion Thank you so much for your thoughtful comments on our activities and for sharing your valuable insights upon the publication of JAL Report 2014. When we relisted our shares, we were firmly resolved to always maintain our sense of gratitude for the support we have received as we strive to become a company that can contribute to society through our air transport business and be needed by society. We have therefore been conducting our CSR activities with an emphasis on efforts unique to JAL. As noted in the Tohoku Support Project, or JAL SORAIKU, our CSR activities are characterized by the participation of very many employees. We believe this is rooted in the awareness we have been cultivating through the JAL Philosophy Session, that “Each of Us Makes JAL What It Is” and that we must “Align Mental Vectors,” as well as the positive attitude described by the formula: “The Result of Life and Work = Attitude × Effort × Ability.” Hiroyuki Hioka We will continue our efforts to contribute to society through activities that uniquely reflect JAL, while firmly keeping Executive Officer, your point in mind as the management so we can lead by example, thinking positively and with passion about “what General Affairs (CSR) kind of JAL we would like to create” and taking action to create the “future JAL” together with our employees.

Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the financial statement audit is not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries as at March 31, 2014 and 2013, and their financial performance and cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
