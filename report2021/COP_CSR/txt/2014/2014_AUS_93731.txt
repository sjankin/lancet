Measuring EME levels at base stations Telstra complies with the safety standards set by ARPANSA, which are based on the safety guidelines recommended by the WHO.

A further $6 million is committed for next year. Collectively, the initiatives completed in FY14 have reduced carbon emissions by 36,824 tCO2e and saved over 35,000MWh of electricity consumption in FY14. Our direct (Scope 1) emissions decreased in FY14. The principal cause was a reduction in the overall number of vehicles in Telstra’s fleet and the increased fuel efficiency of the fleet. While use of diesel and LPG decreased by around two per cent and 28 per cent respectively this year, the use of unleaded petrol and ethanol blend fuel rose substantially. This increase is due to the LPG Ford Falcon station wagon approach by 2.5 per cent this year. In FY14, carbon being discontinued and phased out of emissions intensity was 0.58 tonnes Telstra’s fleet.
