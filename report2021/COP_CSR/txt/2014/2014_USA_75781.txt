Citi Global Citizenship 2013 39 Supporting Small-Scale Farmers in Kenya Farm yields in Sub-Saharan Africa are among the lowest in the world. Most small-scale farmers in the region depend on rain—an unreliable and seasonal source of water—to grow their crops. KickStart International is making progress by developing water pumps that enable farmers in the region to irrigate throughout the year, helping them to improve crop yields and boost their incomes. KickStart’s mission is to lift millions of people in Africa out of poverty— quickly, cost-effectively and sustainably. Unlike traditional aid models, KickStart doesn’t give pumps away, it sells them. According to KickStart’s research, the pump has created 150,000 new family businesses, helped 770,000 people move out of poverty, and allowed 240,000 children to attend school. Despite this, KickStart believes it has only reached 10 percent of the market potential in Kenya. That’s where $2 million in financing from Citi Microfinance and Citi Commercial Bank in partnership with Skoll Foundation comes in. As well as helping KickStart expand the production and distribution of its pumps in Kenya, the loan is an important expression of Citi’s confidence in KickStart’s social enterprise business model. In addition to financing, as a Citi client, Kickstart is able to use Citi banking platforms to operate efficiently around the world. The loan exemplifies Citi’s commitment to enabling progress makers in the social enterprise sector. KickStart estimates that the $2 million loan will help it to distribute 7,782 pumps, move over 31,000 people out of poverty and generate over $27 million in new Martin Fisher, profits and wages in the country Co-founder and CEO, over four years, as well as improve KickStart International food security. 40 SUPPORTING CLIENTS Supporting Veterans and In 2013, the Citi Foundation funded Heroes Get Hired Military Families as Customers the Realizing Your Dream program, to and Employees provide support and opportunities for “Our returning troops In 2012 Citi launched Citi Salutes™, veterans to become business owners formalizing our longtime support for the and entrepreneurs. and their family memgreater military community.

Our Client Service department manages communications with clients and customers, and our @AskCiti Twitter account provides instant access to customer service representatives. We also measure customer satisfaction through surveys and other feedback from customers. We track and manage relationships with institutional clients by coordinating across business units and product lines firm-wide, with individual accountability for each touch-point of the relationship. We also engage with our clients through our application of the Equator Principles and Citi’s ESRM Policy to client transactions. Challenges to Engagement With clients around the world, two-way dialogue may not be available to all of our clients and consumers. Digital engagement (such as through @AskCiti) has helped address this challenge. Additionally, as data privacy concerns become a growing issue, Citi must continue to engage and maintain our clients’ trust. 2013 Example We conduct annual customer satisfaction surveys in our regions. See the Measuring Consumer Satisfaction section of this report for more information. In 2013, Citi provided an assessment of key sustainability challenges facing a client in the agricultural sector, in the client’s corporate responsibility report. INVESTORS (INCLUDING SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTORS) Communication Channel Our Investor Relations department regularly informs and updates our investors on the company’s financial and operational performance. Challenges to Engagement Citi has many investors, and their feedback is as diverse as our shareholders themselves. We always appreciate shareholder feedback. While we may not always agree with our shareholders, we do our best to either address their concerns or explain Citi’s position. Citi has met with several investors and other interested parties regarding such issues as the company’s response to new credit card regulations, derivatives, risk management, mortgages, auditor rotation and trade association payments, among others. We encourage our stockholders to communicate with management and the Board of Directors. 2013 Example We engage with our investors through our Annual Report, Proxy Statement, SEC filings, meetings and our Investor Relations website. In 2013, we continued to make progress in gathering feedback on executive compensation through meetings with major shareholders, including pension funds. EMPLOYEES Communication Channel Citi employees value our dedication to citizenship. Employees are able to support our diversity and inclusion goals through participation in the employee networks. Employee volunteer councils and green teams also provide opportunities for employee engagement. Challenges to Engagement In some of the areas where we operate, local customs and laws may not align directly with our employee diversity programs, which makes engaging on inclusion and sensitivity issues a challenge. 2013 Example Our Voice of the Employee Survey regularly gathers feedback from employees on working at Citi. Citi Global Citizenship 2013 66 APPENDIX: STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT TABLE GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORS Communication Channel Our Citigroup Global Government Affairs group interacts with elected officials and policymakers globally through company outreach or industry association activities, including lobbying, public policy forums and public seminars. Citi’s Global Compliance group maintains a continuous constructive dialogue and partnership with regulators at all levels. The group advises on and coordinates regulatory examinations with the business and other functions. Challenges to Engagement Skepticism surrounding the value of large financial institutions presents a challenge to how we advocate public policy priorities. 2013 Example Citi’s public policy involvement in 2013 covered areas such as financial and tax reform, consumer protections, expanding trade opportunities, strengthening data and security protections. SUPPLIERS Communication Channel We communicate with our more than 13,000 suppliers across 100 countries through our Procurement group. Challenges to Engagement Definitions for diverse and sustainable suppliers differ from country to country, and finding ways to engage such suppliers can be a challenge. 2013 Examples Our Statement of Supplier Principles, which promotes ethical business practices, human rights and environmental sustainability, is communicated to potential suppliers through the request-for-proposal process. In 2013, we hosted the sixth annual Doing Business with Citi forum for diverse suppliers. COMMUNITY LEADERS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) Communication Channel Citi teams across a range of businesses and functions, including Citi Community Development, Corporate Sustainability, Public Affairs, Government Affairs and Legal departments, maintain communication with high-level community and civic leaders locally, nationally and globally. The Community Development @ Citi website houses information on our work to expand financial inclusion and economic empowerment in underserved communities. We also communicate via email and social media and conduct periodic public webinars to provide information on our community development policy and practice. Citi executives and members of the Citi Community Development team serve on local and national boards and policy groups in the U.S. and our team of international public affairs officers manage these relationships in country. We collaborate with NGOs on issues relevant to each group, including financial inclusion, environmental sustainability, community development and human rights. Challenges to Engagement We proactively solicit viewpoints from communities and NGOs advocating a variety of issues around the world. Incorporating NGO input is pivotal to Citi and our approach to citizenship. We implement the feedback that is feasible within the constraints of our business. 2013 Examples Citi engaged with community leaders and NGOs in a number of ways in 2013. Working with the Asset Building Policy Network, a coalition of civil rights and advocacy organizations in the U.S., Citi helped develop policy principles for asset building in underserved communities. Through Citi Dialogues, representatives from Citi businesses met with consumer and community advocates to discuss affordable housing, credit cards, community reinvestment and consumer protection challenges, and other issues affecting the communities we serve. Citi met with NGOs to discuss concerns about questions regarding Citi’s financing of various sectors, including the energy, power, mining, palm oil and defense sectors, as well as about the Equator Principles and paper procurement. These groups included:  eres, C40 Cities, Environmental Defense Fund, Greenpeace, Living Cities, New York City C Energy Efficiency Corporation, Rainforest Action Network, Root Capital, United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and World Resources Institute Citi Global Citizenship 2013 67 APPENDIX: STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT TABLE MEDIA Communication Channel Our Public Affairs department engages with the media through interviews, forums, press releases, social media and reports. Challenges to Engagement Promoting an accurate portrayal of the role financial institutions play in the world economy after the economic crisis remains a challenge. 2013 Example The Citi News website hosts company announcements, achievements and statements. In 2013, Citi executives participated in a number of interviews with local, national and international press on a variety of issues of concern to our shareholders and other stakeholders. OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Communication Channel We communicate with competitors through industry groups, events and benchmarking activities. Challenges to Engagement In the interest of maintaining healthy, free-market competition, any engagement that can be misconstrued as collusion is prohibited. 2013 Examples In 2013, Citi continued to be a member of the Financial Services Roundtable, the leading organization for the U.S. financial services industry. In 2013, we continued to collaborate with 78 other financial institutions on expanding the Equator Principles. See the Environmental and Social Risk Management section in Environmental Sustainability for more information. Citi Global Citizenship 2013 68 U.N.

Relations Citi Global Citizenship 2013 69 ASSURANCES KPMG LLP 345 Park Avenue New York, NY 10154-0102 INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT'S REPORT Citigroup Inc. Board of Directors and Management: We have reviewed management’s assertion, included in the accompanying Appendix A, that the selected Corporate Citizenship metrics identified below and denoted by footnote within the Global Citizenship Report of Citigroup Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2013, are presented in conformity with the reporting criteria set forth in management’s assertion in Appendix A (the Reporting Criteria).  2013 Project Finance Advisories covered by the Equator Principles  2013 Project Finance Loans covered by the Equator Principles  2013 Funded Project Finance Loans by Sector covered by the Equator Principles Citigroup Inc.’s management is responsible for the assertion and for the Reporting Criteria which it has identified as an objective basis against which it assesses and reports on the selected Corporate Citizenship metrics. Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion on management’s assertion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Based on our review, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that management's assertion referred to above is not fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the corresponding Reporting Criteria set forth in Appendix A. New York, New York March 28, 2014 KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership, the U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity. Citi Global Citizenship 2013 70 APPENDIX: ASSURANCES Appendix A Management’s Assertion Citigroup Inc. is responsible for the completeness, accuracy and validity of the Corporate Citizenship metrics contained in the Global Citizenship Report for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Corporate Citizenship metrics presented include Citigroup Inc. and its subsidiary operations. With respect to the Corporate Citizenship metrics summarized below and within the 2013 Global Citizenship Report, Management of Citigroup Inc. asserts that such Corporate Citizenship metrics are presented in conformity with the Reporting Criteria set forth below.

Manufacturing 0 1 0 1 Total 3 4 0 7 Citi’s Equator Principles Reporting Criteria Citi’s Equator Principles (EP) Reporting criteria utilize the Scope section of the Equator Principles (June 2006) to delineate EP-covered project finance transactions (Transactions), which include project finance loans (Loans) and project finance advisory activities (Advisories). The year in which a Loan is reviewed is based on the date that the project has been submitted to business and credit risk senior management for approval to market to the client for consideration to fund their project; and the year in which a Loan is funded is based on the date it is funded by the banks. The year in which an Advisory is reviewed is based on the date the Project Finance department consults the Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Unit1 for approval to market an Advisory role (as is required by Citi’s ESRM policies and standards); and the year in which an Advisory is mandated is the year in which Citi is appointed by the client to serve as the Advisor for a project for a finite period of time. All Transactions are categorized based on the A, B, and C system of environmental and social categorization as defined in the Equator Principles (June 2006). Citi also elects to report funded Loans by industry sector. 1 The ESRM Unit is responsible for review, consultation, and approvals on new transactions, as well as internal training, communications, policy implementation, tracking and reporting. Supporting the unit are “ESRM Champions” — credit risk officers with additional ESRM review and advice responsibilities — located in each region. Citi’s Environmental and Social Policy Review Committee (ESPRC), made up of senior managers from across Citi business units, provides guidance on ESRM issues and related environmental issues. The Director of Corporate Citizenship and Citi's Managing Director of Business Development co-chair the committee.
