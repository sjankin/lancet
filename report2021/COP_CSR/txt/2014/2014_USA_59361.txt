Assessment, Policy and Goals Criterion Technology is committed to the health and safety of our environment and community. Proper disposal and storage of chemicals is taught and enforced. Criterion enhanced the recycling program this year along with the addition of more energy efficient lighting and improved skylights throughout the plant. We also have processes in place to reduce the amount of paper used. Implementation Our policies, work instructions, product specifications, insurance booklets and job descriptions are maintained electronically through the company intranet and we encourage employees to print on both sides of paper sheets. We have a closed loop water system for our injection molding process allowing us to reuse water. We recycle paper, plastic, aluminum and other metals, corrugated cardboard and scrap materials. Recycling bins are placed throughout our facility and employees are encouraged to use them for all recyclable materials. Our heating and air system is programed so that it does not run excessively when the building is unoccupied. Chemicals are disposed of and stored according to state and federal regulations. Our improved skylights reduce the need to use lights throughout the production areas. Measurement of Outcomes All recycled materials and energy reduction are tracked throughout the year. This has allowed us to monitor progress and set goals for improving our programs. The graphs below compare our recycled materials during 2012 and 2013. In 2013 we reduced our plastic material waste which in turn reduced the amount of plastic material we recycled. Our company is becoming more efficient managing the amount of plastic material being wasted from equipment issues. Therefore, the reduced numbers of recycled plastic materials is a direct reflection of decreased scrap.

Several of our clients like instruction manuals to be printed and inserted with the product. In 2012 we were outsourcing these instruction manuals, but this year we started printing these manuals in-house. This explains the increased paper consumption and decreased paper recycled. This year we have incorporated printer cartridges into our recyclable materials. We hope to continue adding more recyclable materials to set an example for maintaining a healthy environment.
