CA TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3 Customer Controlling IT environments Solutions + shifting efficiency CA solutions are the critical foundation for helping customers gain deep insight into and exceptional control over their complex mixed IT environments. This type of control requires visibility into the power, space and cooling of their data centers — visibility that enables organizations to more effectively manage capacity, mitigate risk and improve overall efficiency. RAGINGWIRE INNOVATES WITH CA DCIM RagingWire designs, builds and operates mission-critical data centers that deliver high-density power and 100% availability. The company has 650,000 square feet of critical data center infrastructure in Northern California and Ashburn, Virginia, and the highest customer loyalty scores in the industry. CA Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) is helping to simplify data center operations by replacing and consolidating over 23 point solutions used in data center operations to monitor and manage power, space and cooling. For RagingWire, providing industry-leading DCIM services as a value-add service is a market differentiator that will win new clients and generate additional top-line revenue. AVNET USES CA DCIM TO REDUCE COSTS BY $18 MILLION AND IMPROVE DATA CENTER POWER EFFICIENCY BY 10% Avnet, one of the world’s largest distributors of electronics, implemented CA DCIM to measure, monitor and manage power and cooling in its primary data center.

A growing number of analysts recognize CA Technologies as an emerging leader in providing solutions for public and private cloud computing across diverse virtual and physical platforms. CA TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 Operational Controlling our footprint Efficiency + shifting our priorities At CA Technologies, we work to control and shrink our environmental footprint by gathering and acting on knowledge, looking for opportunities to innovate, and forming strategic alliances to combine efforts. In many cases, these efforts also help reduce operating costs. Here are some of the ways we improve the efficiency of our own operations. Renewable energy: We are dedicated to reducing our carbon footprint and advancing renewable energy technologies. For example, wind power supplies 100% of the power at our Darmstadt, Germany, and Framingham, MA, facilities, and renewable energy provides 30% of the power for our facilities in Melbourne and Sydney in Australia. On the supply side, CA Technologies continues its program of buying renewable energy certificates (RECs) from commercial electricity supplier Glacial Energy. Information technology: We have several ongoing initiatives to reduce our energy consumption and overall carbon footprint. During 2013, consolidating servers in our data centers enabled us to decommission 170 servers, producing annual savings of more than 96,000 kWh and 140 metric tons of CO2e. Server virtualization technology enables us to rapidly provision logical servers that run on one physical server, resulting in additional savings on power and hardware maintenance costs. On the desktop, we use our Asset Management solution to configure power management settings to turn off monitors and spin down hard drives after a period of inactivity, saving energy and prolonging the life of the monitors and disk drives. GHG emissions. CA Technologies began measuring its GHG emissions in 2006, reporting results through CDP. Operational improvements have enabled us to reduce our carbon footprint by approximately 26% since 2006. Specific activities that have contributed to this success include acting on opportunities for lighting reduction, smart-spacing our facilities, and implementing efficiencies in our data centers and labs. Our efforts in this area are reflected in our increased CDP disclosure score. In 2013 we received a 90 out of 100, up from an 84 the previous year. Strategic alliances with business partners. We have formed strategic alliances with a number of leading organizations, including Cisco, Deloitte, and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL). Green buildings and green leases. CA Technologies developed, owns and occupies a 200,000-square-foot SICI Green Building (India’s equivalent of LEED-certified) in Hyderabad, India. In addition, we lease approximately 140,000 square feet of office space in LEED-certified buildings across the United States, with another 85,000 square feet pending LEEDcertification at CA’s Silicon Valley Technology Center, in Santa Clara, CA. We continue to work with our global real estate service providers to incorporate sustainability elements into all new leases, including provisions requiring use of efficient and regularly serviced building systems, use of cleaning materials that are Green Seal–certified, building recycling programs, lighting sensors in common areas, and landscape irrigation systems that utilize rain sensor devices to minimize water usage. In 2013, we completed a building management system upgrade at our Islandia, NY, office, giving us greater control of building efficiency at our largest location. The Islandia facility is a 778,000-square-foot office building in which we manage the entire property and occupy approximately 575,000 square feet, or 18%, of our entire global occupied space. CA TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 6 Waste management. CA Technologies has a corporate-wide global commitment to minimize its impact on landfills by reducing, reusing, recycling and respecting. As an example of this commitment, our Ditton Park, U.K., facility is recycling cooking oil from the building’s restaurant into biodiesel fuel and sending all food waste from the restaurant for composting off-site. These two actions have resulted in waste reduction of more than 10 metric tons each year. In total, only 33% of the facility’s waste goes to landfill. Water management. We are a software company, so our operations are not water-intensive. Water discharges are attributable primarily to our office buildings. While most of our facilities are located in multi tenant properties where we cannot exercise complete control, our data centers have closed-loop water systems and use minimal water. In addition, we reclaim 100% of rainwater from surfaces at our Hyderabad, India facility and use it for our landscaping needs. We currently have metered water data for 13 facilities. For our Islandia, NY, office, we estimate that we used approximately 22.2 million gallons of water in 2013, compared to 26.7 million gallons in 2012. Energy. CA Technologies Framingham, MA, facility participates in the EPA’s Energy Green Partnership program, a voluntary initiative that encourages organizations to use green power as a way to reduce the environmental impacts associated with electricity use. We created CA DCIM to measure and manage power and cooling and overall physical capacity in our data centers and facilities around the globe. We also have developed and use energy management products. We use New York Power Authority (NYPA) energy in Islandia and contract for wind energy through Glacial Green in Framingham, Portsmouth and Petaluma. We have an energy and sustainability manager now on board for FY 2015 through JLL.
