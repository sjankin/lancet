In 2010, overseas production capacity surpassed domestic production capacity. In 2013, 61.2% of Yen, made 2013 a year of many challenges. Fortunately, Hyundai had completed the establishment Hyundai vehicles were produced at overseas plants. The increase is due to completion of new production of a global production network with production facilities in all key markets in both developed and plant in China which now has a 1 million unit production capacity and also because HMC began operation of emerging economies. As a result, production capacity has increased by 16.9% between 2012 and 2013. its first plant in Brazil. In 2013, construction of the Sichuan Hyundai Co., Ltd. plant was commenced which is Hyundai is producing high quality automobiles that are embedded with its management philosophy and the first Hyundai plant in China. The plant will begin production of 150,000 trucks per year starting in 2014. is responding to stakeholder opinions as a responsible international automaker. We are also striving to The number of vehicles produced in overseas plants increased to 2,919,550 units in 2013 which was a 16.9% provide excellent customer service that suits the needs of customers in different regions and become a increase. Overall production volume was increased to 4,770,277 units which represented an 8.4% increase. positive force in the local communities in which we operate. The expanded global production network strengthened HMC’s capacity to more effectively manage the risks of the ever-changing business conditions. Global sales HMC had yet another year of growth despite slow European economy. In 2013, the number of vehicles Hyundai vehicles produced at the Ulsan plant are produced by Hyundai was over 4.73 million units, which was 7.3% increase from previous year. In Korea, sales shipped to markets all over the world from the near-by Ulsan port. have decreased by 4.1% due to a mild economic recession and a lack of new models released in the year. Photo: A view of Ulsan port with Hyundai vehicles waiting to be loaded However, the new Genesis launched in November 2013 had strong initial sales with 12,000 units sold by the end of first month of release indicating strong sales in 2014. In 2013, the number of vehicles produced and sold from overseas plants was 4,091,668 units which accounted for 86.5% of total sales. Sale of overseas produced vehicles has been steadily increasing. In the North American market, the number of vehicles sold increased by 2.3% to 858,424. The low interest rate and increased demand for replacement vehicles were identified as the main contributing factors that led to the increase in sales. Sales in the Asian and Chinese markets increased by 21.2% thanks to the strong sales of the Mistra, a localized mid-sized sedan, and other localized models in China. In 2014, combined production capacity of three plants was increased by 150,000 units which create potential for increased production and sales of Hyundai vehicles in the Chinese market. European economy had yet another slow year in 2013. Lack of confidence in the economic recovery in the Euro zone led to reduced overall demand for automobiles with sales down by 8.6% with 445,700 fewer units sold in 2013. The global economy is expected to have a much slower recovery from the financial crisis than was previously predicted. As a result, the global automotive market is expected to experience a slow down for some years to come. Such expectations have made HMC shift its focus to qualitative growth through internal improvements and building capacity for future competitiveness. In addition to building internal capacity, we plan to increase sales by 2.7% to 4.9 million units. 2013 Global production volume 2013 Global sales volume 4,770,277 units 8.4% 4,732,533 units 7.3% Sustainability Management: Philosophy and Foundation 4 The Road to Sustainability Creating Shared Value 32 Sustainability Management: Philosophy and Foundation Top 5 Sustainable Management Issues 56 Sustainability Management Performance 84 22 23 01.

Renewable energy is energy justice cleaner but has intermittency issues which require large energy storage devices. The most efficient energy storage solution is hydrogen production and storage. Hydrogen does not generate any pollution when it is used and it can easily be transported and stored in liquid or gaseous form. It can be also produced using water, making it one of the most promising sources of energy of future. A transition from fossil fuel to hydrogen will allow us to break away from carbon emissions.

H2O An FCEV runs on hydrogen and has a fuel cell electric system which consists of a fuel cell stack, an electric motor, a control unit, a battery and a hydrogen tank. When hydrogen ix35 Fuel Cell 0g ix35 Fuel Cell from the hydrogen tank is supplied to the fuel cell stack, hydrogen is broken into a hydrogen ion and an electron. The hydrogen ion then reacts with oxygen and become water while the electron is sent to the motor which creates torque for the car. Nothing but Conventional car Conventional car NO2 pure water is generated during the process making it a zero emission vehicle. Considering H2S C2H12 CO2 NH3 CO that automobiles are the major source of pollution especially in urban areas, an FCEV is a Gasoline 130g O3 Fossil Fuel Vehicle tremendous improvement over conventional technology. Hyundai manufactured its first fuel cell electric car in 1998 and subsequently launched 0.5km 1.0km 1.5km project “Polaris” which aimed to develop a propriety fuel cell stack for an automotive application. In 2006, Hyundai succeeded in developing a high-performance fuel cell ◎ Charging time and range stack made of in-house developed parts. The development team made improvements in performance, successful modularization, lower cost materials and mass production methods with the aim of creating the world’s first mass production FCEV. Finally, Hyundai began Electric car FCEV operation of the first FCEV mass production plant for the Tucson ix FCEV in 2013. 140km 594km In 2012, the Tucson ix FCEV successfully completed a European road tour proving its 1st reliability and environmental benefits, and the vehicles were then supplied to the market. In 2014, the Tucson ix FCEV will be launched in Korea and the US. As of March 2014, FCEVs EV ix35 Fuel Cell are supplied to government organizations in a small volume, but they will be made available EV H2 for regular consumers later this year. Single Charge Start Start Single Charge World’s first FCEV The establishment of a mass production plant for the FCEV was made possible through Charging time : 30 minutes Charging time: 3 minutes Range per charge: up to 140 km Range per charge: up to 594 km mass production close collaboration with suppliers. More than 120 suppliers participated in the development starts operation and production of necessary parts. Hyundai made an extra effort to develop core parts inin 2013 house and in-Korea. Thanks to the effort, more than 95% of parts are supplied either inhouse or by Korean suppliers. We have come a long way in improving part performance Begin first US sales of FCEVs Accelerating the future FCEVs have proven green credentials. However, hydrogen infrastructure is necessary to to regular consumers and achieving reductions in cost, and we expect to benefit significantly as the FCEV market make the FCEV viable for regular consumers which will require support from governments in 2014 expands overseas. and other stakeholders. In Korea, there are 13 hydrogen stations, most of which are located in major cities. Hydrogen stations are far fewer in numbers compared to gas stations. Although there is only small number of stations, it only takes 3 to 5 minutes to fully FCEVs emit nothing but 100% pure water, making charge an FCEV which allow a single station to charge 400 to 1,000 FCEVs per day. We it an ideal vehicle of future. Tucson ix FCEV (right) will be launched in the US market in 2014. expect more hydrogen stations to be built in the near future making charging much more convenient. In the meantime, supplying large quantities of hydrogen for the small number of hydrogen stations may cause some issues. The US government and European Union are introducing new policies to support FCEVs as a means of achieving reductions in carbon emissions. The US government is implementing various support policies for green cars and specific incentives for FCEVs which is expected to accelerate the expansion of the hydrogen infrastructure. The state of California has passed a new policy to incentivize the transition to low carbon vehicles which includes a significant budget for the establishment of hydrogen stations. In-depth dialogue with relevant stakeholders will be necessary before extensive hydrogen infrastructure can be established.. Hyundai also needs to implement programs and initiatives to actively promote FCEVs. Anticipating the coming of the hydrogen age, there are a number of institutions and organizations that represent the hydrogen industry. The Korea Hydrogen Industry Association, the first organization that represents hydrogen industry was created in January 2014. We expect the association to grow as more companies join. Hyundai will actively work with the association to prepare for the hydrogen age.

It also generates almost zero noise and vibration, and it can be charged using a domestic electric outlet. Thanks to fast evolving technologies, recently released electric vehicles (EVs) have a longer range than before. However, most EVs have a much shorter range per charge and take much longer to charge than conventional vehicles or FCEVs. Electric vehicle charging infrastructure status (Korea) In Korea, there are 959 EV charging points which were established with support from the Ministry of Environment. The ministry plan to increase the number of charging points to 1.35 million by 2020. For the foreseeable future, the bulk of EV sales are expected to come from car-sharing companies rather than individual consumers. However, a transition is expected soon after, and Hyundai is developing an advanced compact EV to ride the trend. National Research Project on Compact EV Development HMC is participating in the ‘Green Mobility System based on Next-generation Electric Vehicles’ commissioned by the South Korean government, as one of 43 partners including large corporations, SMEs, universities and research institutes. The participants plan to invest a total of 84 billion Korean Won (KRW) between Hyundai has been receiving life cycle May 2011 and April 2014; 44.2 billion KRW from the government and 39.8 billion KRW from assessments to assess total CO2 emissions involved from the production of materials to private sector participants. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop an affordable electric the operation and disposal/recycling of the car following the Ministry of Environment’s carbon powertrain for a compact car. The team is striving to achieve a driving range per single charge of footprint certification protocol. The Sonata Hybrid has 17.6 t-CO2 of carbon footprint. over 200 km, a 0 to 100 km/h acceleration time of 11.5 seconds, a charging time of five hours for slow charging and 23 minutes for rapid charging. HMC is aiming to launch a compact EV in 2016 that meets these project goals. Low carbon product logo Leading the low carbon transition forward with green cars BlueOn EV Hyundai has released a number of EVs including the Sonata EV in 1991 and the first Korean highway capable BlueOn in 2010. The BlueOn EV is equipped with a lithium-ion polymer Average lifetime mileage of 120,000 km was used to calculate CO2 emissions of an automobile battery and a range of new electric drive components to provide top class performance. It has over its complete life span. The Sonata Hybrid has the most advanced hybrid electric system an incredible range of 140 kilometers on a single charge. The top speed of the BlueOn is 130 km/ developed by Hyundai which reduces its carbon footprint by 5.2 tons-CO2. Hyundai is making a h and it can accelerate from zero to 100 km/h in 15.7 seconds. All of the core EV components sustained effort to improve HEV technologies, improve systems to induce fuel saving behaviors, were developed domestically, strengthening the foundation for continued improvements in EV employ more bio-plastics, and so on in order to reduce carbon footprint associated with our technologies in Korea.

Epilogue Before the Glove, I had never thought that Hyundai Motor would have This year’s report marks our 12th sustainability report. such an impact on my life. I always suffered from limitations in my mobility Thirteen years have passed since we published our first sustainability report. As we began preparing for the 2013 Sustainability Report, and thought I would never be a customer of an automobile company, but we decided to review our past reports and overhaul the way it is organized. We consulted with top management, various divisions, and the Glove team taught me that I might just be a Hyundai owner in future; consultation agencies and concluded that we must never forget that this report is a communication channel. More specifically, we decided to organize this year’s report not as a ‘report but a ‘book’. The 2014 report does not completely depart an exciting thought. This year’s Idea Festival fulfilled my personal wish; I from previous reports, but significant changes were made to enhance our communication with stakeholders. hope the Idea Festival lives on and provides similar great joy to many more First, we decided to maintain a ‘Creating Shared Value’-centered perspective. By maintaining the CSV-focused organizational structure, people. we can report progress made in a consistent manner from an objective perspective in a transparent manner. We also made an effort to feature honest opinions of stakeholders. Second, we decided to report on how high-priority issues were identified through a ‘Materiality test’, taking into account Hyundai’s and other stakeholders’ priorities. We placed strong emphasis on making this year’s report more than a mere collection of data, so we included detailed information on Hyundai’s activities, achievement, future plans, and the philosophy behind them. Third, we gave much thought to how we cover activities that do not fall into either CSV or top priority issues. Most importantly, we felt that CSR activities should be well covered in the report since they are an important part of our sustainability management. We also deliberately used a dry, and matter of fact tone for the sustainability management achievements and CSR activities sections. In terms of layout design, we employed the design theme of the 2013 report, which employed blue and constellations, for consistency in the way we communicate our corporate identity and philosophy. When we first introduced CSV activities in the 2013 Sustainability Report, we thought that we would not see rapid progress in some of the areas. However, we realized that there is actually a significant possibility of making visible progress if we focus our efforts over a sustained period of time. We are committed to making a sustained effort in CSV activities, that reflects Hyundai’s management philosophy and corporate identity, and CSR activities.
