Corporate Social Responsibility 2012 TFP Solutions Berhad’s (TFP) Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) core philosophy is based on United Nations Global Compact principles. In 2012, TFP contributed to a few CSR projects in Malaysia. TFP is committed to contribute to our society as we believe that it could bring positive benefits to our business. 2012 has been a busy year for TFP Group. However, we have not lost focus on the need of our contribution to the society. Since 2009, TFP has “adopted” an underprivileged home, “House of Joy” (HOJ), in Puchong. House of Joy is a nonproﬁt charitable home that administers shelter, care and training to orphans, children and teens who are underprivileged, abused, abandoned, neglected, poor and/or delinquent. In 2012, TFP staff has contributed and provided both in terms of monetary and time efforts to continue supporting the underprivileged home. In 2012, apart from the above efforts, TFP Group has also made monetary contribution to the following organisations: • Chempaka Physiotherapy Center • Taiwan Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation The total monetary contribution by TFP amounted to RM 10,000 in 2012. The staff of TFP also contributed efforts to assist these underprivileged organisations in the celebration of festival activities, for example, Chinese New Year, Christmas and Hari Raya. To continue with our “Green” culture in TFP, we continue to strive on our efforts to protect our environment through energy conservation and recycling campaign to reduce our carbon emission within our organisation. The “Green” campaign involves the following activities: • Reusing of printed papers • Installation of recycle bins within the organisation • Disposal of recycle waste and e-waste to recycling • Efforts to measure and reduce our electrical power usage in the organisation 16 TFP Solutions Berhad
