A highlight was our inclusion in the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for the first time. This achievement acknowledges Oil Search’s long-term commitment to improving sustainability performance and recognises the Company as a strong sustainability performer in our industry. Oil Search is committed to using the Company’s resources, skills and knowledge to support regulatory change and sustainable development. During Oil Search’s ten years as an operator in PNG, more than 320,000 patients have been treated at medical centres we support and nearly 805 tertiary students undertook further study with an Oil Search sponsorship. Since 2009, local land owner companies received US$314 million in seed capital and contracts with Oil Search. As well as helping to manage operating risks, this approach is the right thing to do and is ingrained in our business model. During 2013, Oil Search’s programme of activities addressed key sustainability issues, notably transparency, good governance, community development and health care. For example we made significant progress in demonstrating and encouraging the adoption of the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in PNG. We remained committed to embedding the principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and continued our active participation in the Australian Global Compact Network. The Oil Search Health Foundation continued to grow, in particular the reach of the HIV programme. Continuing to advocate for change in these areas is an industry responsibility and we endeavour to lead by example and work cooperatively with several of our peers. I encourage others to join us. We kept the market informed about Oil Search’s approach to material non-financial issues at our first Investor Sustainability Briefing in September 2013. The response was positive and we intend to make it an annual event. With further business growth ahead, strengthening our safety function remained a top priority and pleasingly our safety performance improved during the year. The new Health, Safety and Sustainability Board Committee will support Oil Search’s strategic planning and performance in these core areas to meet stakeholder and Company expectations. A significantly reorganised Commercial function will oversee future strategic and commercial activities and in 2014 will lead the Company through a company-wide Strategic Review that will outline Oil Search’s direction for the next five years. As in 2013, progress on some sustainability projects may temporarily slow down until the outcomes from this review are available to align and embed our sustainability direction and activities with Oil Search’s new corporate objectives. With 2014 shaping up to be a watershed year, we also decided to introduce a fresh new look. The updated Oil Search logo is a visual representation of the way our Company has evolved and our commitment to future growth. We have also moved to greener offices in Sydney and Brisbane, with Port Moresby’s move scheduled for later this year. These are exciting times for Oil Search and our stakeholders. Staying true to our sustainability principles will play an important role in our ability to deliver future shareholder value and I look forward to sharing our progress with you. PETER BOTTEN MANAGING DIRECTOR 5 L etter f rom the health , sa f ety and sustainability COMMIT TEE CHAIR With PNG LNG Project revenues beginning to flow in 2014, a new period of growth and transformation lies ahead for Oil Search. The new Health, Safety and Sustainability (HSS) Committee will further support Oil Search’s commitment to sustainability, guiding the Company’s strategic and operational activities during this time of fundamental change and beyond. In line with the Committee’s charter, our activities have a strong risk focus. Proactively managing the operating risks presented by social, economic and environmental issues not only helps Oil Search to drive business value, it creates a long-term legacy of national and local improvement wherever we operate. This values-driven approach is an essential part of who we are as a company and differentiates Oil Search. A major objective in 2013 was clarifying the most material sustainability issues in support of our growth plans so we could put in place activities and plans to manage them. Oil Search’s international expansion strategy includes further exploration and drilling in the Taza block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. As we expand into new regions, we look to build on our current strengths in stakeholder engagement and environmental and social risk management to benefit investors, host communities and governments. As part of preliminary risk activities for Taza in 2013, we undertook reviews to ensure we understand sustainability risks, have the right information and are well positioned for likely further expansion in the area during 2014 and beyond. In 2013, Oil Search made steady progress in more effectively understanding our potential human rights risks. A legal review of relevant local legislation and security agreements was completed and a current practices review commenced. These are early steps in a comprehensive process which will continue to be developed in 2014. The outcomes of these activities will be considered in the corporate sustainability aspects of the management system review, being conducted by the business during 2014. This Sustainability Report contains a succinct overview of our performance and activities in 2013 and references information contained in other reports, including our Transparency Report, Sustainability Data Book or the PNG Perspective In-Country Sustainability Report. With Oil Search entering a major new phase of growth in 2014 and the upcoming Strategic Review, 2014 will be a busy year for the HSS Committee. I hope to report significant progress against our sustainability objectives in next year’s Sustainability Report. keith spence HSS COMMITTEE CHAIR 4 O il S earch S U S TA IN AB I LI T Y Report 2 01 3 “ H e a lt h , s a f e t y a n d s u s ta i n a b i l it y (HSS ) u n d e r pi n O i l S e a rc h ’ s s o c i a l l i c e n c e to o p e r at e .

Following the discovery of oil at Taza 1, drilling on Taza 2 began in December 2013. Taza 2 is the first of up to five wells on this block; the acquisition of up to 500 km2 of 3D seismic data, which is expected to commence in early 2014, will further support our expansion strategy in this region. The Semda 1 exploration well in Tunisia reached total depth with no indication of hydrocarbons. Further 2D seismic in the south of the Tajerouine PSC is planned mid-2014.

In February 2014, the Company added to these gas resources with the acquisition of a 22.835% interest in PRL15. Located in the onshore Papuan Basin, the licence contains the Elk/Antelope gas discoveries, the largest undeveloped gas resource in PNG. In 2013, Oil Search achieved total oil and gas production of 6.74 mmboe, 6% higher than in 2012.

This is a mechanism for ensuring that infrastructure projects inside the project area committed to by the Government are implemented. The initial version of the SRM (since revised) was approved by the PNG National Executive Council in September 2013. It aims to improve the execution of Government infrastructure commitments included in legacy oil Memorandum of Agreements and the PNG LNG Project-related umbrella benefits sharing agreement (UBSA). Ensuring social licence in new areas In 2013, Oil Search undertook a strategically important seismic, exploration and drilling programme in Mananda in the Hela Province. The remote location is only accessible by helicopter so to ensure any community concerns were resolved quickly, an Oil Search Community Affairs team member and local Village Liaison Officer were always on-site. The land belongs to multiple clans so a Mananda Village Liaison Committee was formed as a day-to-day intermediary and a forum in which to resolve any landowner disputes. 18 O il S earch S U S TA IN AB I LI T Y Report 2 01 3 $86M Oil Search supported the PNG LNG Project Operator, ExxonMobil PNG, to provide logistical and advisory assistance to the Department of Petroleum and Energy’s (DPE) benefits-related clan vetting programme.

As well as ensuring an adequate supply of goods and services, it provides an important source of income for local community shareholders and is a key factor in mitigating landowner-related problems. 34 During 2013, the Company continued to work with KutMor Limited, an umbrella Lanco which Oil Search helped to establish in 2012. KutMor represents community members from the Kutubu and Moran areas of PNG. Oil Search provided advice and seconded a Company staff member to KutMor’s management team to assist with building capacity. During the year, KutMor provided Oil Search with labour, vehicle and equipment hire services and undertook minor civil works.

The ongoing transition of major spend categories to fixed price agreements continued, with 13 more agreements finalised in 2013. There are now 16 fixed price agreements in place, with a further five scheduled to be completed in 2014. Coupled with a new automated purchasing function, this provides Oil Search with a simpler procurement process with greater visibility. The programme of improvements will continue in 2014. Sustainable supply chain strategy under development Oil Search’s ability to manage ethical, environmental and human rights considerations within the supply chain is an important consideration from risk management, sustainable development and continuous improvement perspectives. In 2012, sustainable supply chain management was identified as an issue of stakeholder interest, and the objective in 2013 was to develop a sustainable supply chain strategy. During the year the Company took some important initial steps, including bringing together Procurement, Assurance and Compliance and Sustainability personnel to identify potential priority areas to focus on in 2014. To suit the varying L o c a l p ro d u ce fo r s a l e , K i ko r i m a r ke t s , G u l f P ro v i n ce . complexity of local businesses’ needs, this will be a multi-year plan, developed and implemented with input from stakeholders across the Company and within the supply chain. During 2013, eight supplier audits were conducted, 32% covering the safety management and performance of Oil Search’s aviation service providers. In 2014, the supplier audit programme will be expanded to include bribery and corruption management. o f PNG s u p p l i e r co n t r ac t e x p e n d i t u r e i n 2 0 1 3 wa s pa i d t o l o c a l s u p p l i e r s Local suppliers include all suppliers paid in PNG Kina.

PNG waste improvement programme delivered Being able to process and dispose of waste is an ongoing challenge in countries such as PNG, where operations are remote and government waste infrastructure and associated services are underdeveloped. As a result, the responsible management of waste is an important consideration. To drive resource recovery and re-use in PNG, Oil Search made substantial progress in the delivery of waste management solutions in 2013. The following innovations were implemented in late 2013. Installation of a composting unit: A ‘Hot Rot’ composting unit was installed at the Ridge Camp’s waste management area to reduce incinerator load. All food waste from the Ridge, Moro and Fofari camp kitchens, along with wood‑based waste, is being processed by the unit. It is anticipated that 730 tonnes of food waste a year will be composted, delivering greater incinerator efficiency and improving local air quality. The composted material is utilised across camp gardens and rehabilitation areas requiring soil. Sludge waste oil reprocessing and disposal: A centrifuge was installed to process sludge into re-usable crude and waste. This reduced the volume of potentially hazardous material stored on-site, and resulted in reduced incinerator load, improved air quality, and recovered approximately 2,140 bbls or US$0.2M worth of crude. Junk chemicals removal: The management of chemicals is an important component of Oil Search’s Environmental Management System. The risks to people and the environment can be reduced by improved logistics and storing and disposing of chemicals safely. Previously, the Company had more than 980 tonnes of chemical waste stored on-site, most of which was already present when Oil Search took over as operator in PNG in 2003. After consolidating the waste, 750 tonnes of non-hazardous material was disposed of in a new landfill containment cell on-site. The remaining 230 tonnes of hazardous waste has been shipped to Australia in accordance with the Basel Convention. This programme removes the potential for previously stored chemicals to enter or contaminate the environment and minimises risks to the health and safety of the local workforce. Segregated waste streams: Bins to segregate kitchen, paper, cardboard, plastic, metal and general waste are being adopted across sites in PNG. The segregation of kitchen waste commenced in 2013 at three camps, with materials now being processed by the composting unit. Metal recycling also began in 2013, with 14 containers sent for reprocessing and sale. 32 O il S earch S U S TA IN AB I LI T Y Report 2 01 3 1,619 7, 5 3 1 755 53,171 43, 266 wa s t e d i s p o s e d ( m 3) I N C I N E R AT I O N O N -S I T E S T O R A G E L ANDFILL R E C YC L I N G The data reported relates to field operations in PNG only.

Workshops attended by senior management and a cross section of other staff were conducted Data Book. to define what key competencies and behaviours Oil Search now requires in its future leaders. These competencies will be embedded into future recruitment processes, leadership development programmes and succession planning approaches in 2014. Employee development opportunities increased In 2013, 124 employees completed the revised ‘Leading the Oil Search Way’ leadership programme for first time leaders in Oil Search. All employees and contractors in PNG were provided the opportunity to improve their confidence and experience public speaking at one of two new public speaking groups established on site. Also during the 34 O il S earch S U S TA IN AB I LI T Y Report 2 01 3 66 year, members of the senior management team and other selected 64 63 employees participated in a range of external technical and leadership development programmes. The revised Leadership Framework will inform further leadership programmes for 2014 and 2015. Talent and succession management A number of formal talent and succession reviews were conducted 21 22 during 2013 which focussed on potential leaders, key technical staff 20 and other emerging talent. Aimed at building leadership and technical talent, a number of development assignments and staff transfers 11 12 13 resulted from the reviews. In some cases external recruitment was used to supplement internal talent and to address specific capability tota l wo r k fo rc e gaps.
