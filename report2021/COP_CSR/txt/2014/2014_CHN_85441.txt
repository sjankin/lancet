Today, with the development of global economic integration, enterprises striving for sustainable development are not only faced with increasingly fierce market competition at home and abroad, but are also faced with the pressure of improving their own level of scientific management and enhancing their core competitiveness. Enterprises must attach great importance to management, through which they shall create profits and be responsible for the interests of their shareholders, assume their responsibility for employees, society and environment, and be better exemplars in observing business ethics, ensuring work safety, safeguarding occupational health, protecting the lawful rights and interests of the workers and intensively and economically utilizing resources. In short, enterprises cannot develop and grow without management, nor can they fulfill social responsibility without management. During its more than 20 years of operation, CNAF has always taken it as its own responsibility to “Do our best to serve global civil aviation clients, and guarantee aviation fuel supply for our country” . On the one hand, we have emphasized strategic transformation and optimization and upgrading, and laid stress on the economic aggregate, scale and speed of our corporate growth; on the other hand, we have emphasized up-skilling our workforce and improving management, and by focusing on consolidating enterprise management, we have better fulfilled social responsibility and achieved the harmonious development of enterprises and employees, society and environment. For over 30 years since reform and opening up, through in-depth reform, mechanism transformation and innovative development, the central State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have considerably improved their management, vigorously promoted the improvement of their economic results and competitiveness, and made contributions to the rapid development of national economy. However, certain problems, such as the weak foundation in enterprise management and the shortcomings to be corrected in management, need to be effectively solved. In March 2012, according to the general thought on reform and development of the central SOEs during the “12th Five-Year” period, the SASAC of the State Council proposed ongoing management improvement in the central SOEs and concentrated on pushing ahead the improvement of their overall management, which has laid a solid foundation for their sustainable development. As an important member of the central SOEs, in taking seriously the expectations of the society and fulfilling the goals set by the State, we must identify the gaps in management and strengthen management in the course of corporate development. Over the years, we have actively constructed the standard corporate governance structure with the Board of Directors at the core, shaped the check and balance mechanism among decision-making bodies, supervisory bodies and operation managers, and gradually realized the shift from traditional enterprise management to a modern corporate system. We have endeavored to put into practice the thinking of modern corporate management, highlighted strategic and people-oriented thinking, and focused on intensive mode of business, professional management and integrated operation to upgrade the Group’ s management and control capability and management efficiency. We have vigorously carried out the resources, market and internationalization strategies and organized and formed the four business segments of aviation fuel, oil product trade, logistics and overseas business to constantly push forward the development of main businesses and achieved a steady increase in operating performance. We have continuously strengthened basic management, laid stress on the quality and results of development, and constantly improved the levels of “three-basic” construction, safety management, risk control and social responsibility management, enabling our market competitiveness and anti-risk capability to be further reinforced. Through years of efforts, we have notably enhanced our scale and strength, continuously improved our economic results, constantly optimized our systems and mechanisms, further consolidated our management foundation, and remarkably upgraded our management efficiency. We have grown into the fifth largest aviation fuel supplier and the second largest aviation fuel service provider in the world and the largest aviation fuel supplier and aviation fuel service provider in Asia. As management master Peter F. Drucker once said, “Management is a kind of practice whose essence doesn’ t lie in ‘knowledge’ but in ‘practice’ and whose verification doesn’ t lie in logic but in results.” In the Sun Li, future, we will strengthen management and take it as the fundamental path and effective means of corporate Chairman of the China National Aviation development. We will follow the requirements of the modern corporate system to comprehensively deepen corporate reform and development, push ahead management innovation, accelerate the transformation of Fuel Group Corporation development modes, make efforts to enhance core competitiveness and conscientiously raise the overall management of the Group Corporation to a new height, thus laying a solid management foundation for building a first-rate global comprehensive aviation fuel corporation and for guaranteeing safe aviation fuel supply of the country. In the future, we will actively practice responsibility as a central SOE, continue to pay close attention to the impact of corporate activities on the economy, society and environment, maintain good communication with our stakeholders, employees and clients, share the corporate development results with all stakeholders, and join hands with all parties to help attain the “Chinese Dream” featuring the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through the success of the “CNAF Dream” .
