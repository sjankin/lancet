In this manner, I feel that the plan got off to a strong start. The current operating environment is a difficult one, though, and continues to warrant vigilance.

Marubeni Annual Report 2014 11 Message from the President Looking Back on the Year Ended March 31, 2014 In the year ended March 31, 2014, our consolidated operating results under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were as follows: total volume of trading transactions increased 27.7%, to ¥13,633.5 billion; operating profit rose 22.6%, to ¥157.5 billion; and profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent*1 was up 62.1%, to ¥210.9 billion, exceeding our target of ¥210.0 billion and setting a new record high. Looking back at the operating environment during the year, the overall trend in the global economy was of gradual recovery as the relatively strong conditions in the United States and Japan outweighed economic concerns in emerging countries. Reflecting unclear conditions in the Middle East, crude oil prices were highly volatile, and we saw increases in both crude oil prices and grain prices during the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, commodity prices were generally low throughout the year. In Japan, yen depreciation, stock price increases, and improvements in economic conditions resulted in rising consumption levels. These and other benefits of economic stimulus measures continued to drive the ongoing recovery of the domestic economy. The fourth quarter demand rush that preceded the consumption tax hike also contributed to this recovery. In April 2013, the Company launched its new three-year medium-term management plan, Global Challenge 2015 (GC2015), under the guidance of a new management system, and I feel that the plan got off to a strong start in its first year. 12 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Strategy Building a Solid Business Portfolio Business to Realize Ongoing Improvements in Corporate Value Sustainability Corporate Governance Advance Toward Goals of GC2015 GC2015 calls for us to leverage Marubeni’s strengths and expertise in order to expand businesses in which it can play a leading role, focusing on business fields where it has competitiveness. In doing so, we aim to achieve a strong earnings structure and build a solid financial base while continuing to grow. Specifically, in the year ending March 31, 2016, the final year of GC2015, we are targeting profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent*1 in the range of ¥250.0 billion to ¥300.0 billion, a consolidated net debt–equity ratio of approximately 1.5 times, stable ROE of 15% or more, and ROA of 4% or more. Marubeni has been taking an ongoing approach toward revising its business portfolio since the turn of the century. As a result, we have succeeded in creating an earnings structure that ensures stable revenues.

Marubeni Annual Report 2014 13 Message from the President harsh environment for natural resource businesses, is largely a result of this unceasing attention toward reforming our business portfolio. To help us pursue the ongoing growth targeted by GC2015, we have defined three key measures, and, to advance these measures more effectively, have set up three strategic committees that I chair: the PM (Portfolio Management) Strategy Committee, the GM (Global Market) Strategy Committee, and the HR (Human Resources) Strategy Committee. Measures are currently being advanced by these committees. Earnings Structure and Business Portfolio (%) (%) 1 Food group 10 9 Energy & Chemicals group 11 19 Metals & Mineral Resources 12 group Profit for the 20 12 Machinery group year attributable to Total assets* owners of the parent* Lifestyle, Forest Products, ICT & Realty group 11 ¥7,255.4 billion 19 ¥210.9 billion Overseas 9 Corporate & Elimination, etc. 25 29 13 Year ended March 31, 2014 As of March 31, 2014 14 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Strategy Progress of the Three Key Measures In regard to the first key measure—optimize management resources—we aim to build a business portfolio that can generate profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent* in the range of ¥250.0 billion to ¥300.0 billion in any business environment. Realizing ongoing growth with limited management resources will require an unceasing process of reviewing asset portfolios to optimize management resources. In other words, the profitability of existing businesses must be thoroughly improved, and assets that lack profitability must be replaced. Based on this realization, the PM Strategy Committee evaluated each business area Business during the year ended March 31, 2014, the first year of GC2015. The committee analyzed the profitability, efficiency, and growth potential of each business field, and, after thorough consideration, determined future policies for management resource allocation. Going forward, we will employ these policies to reallocate monetary and human resources, replace assets, strategically exit businesses, and conduct other ongoing initiatives to optimize management resources. To strengthen/expand overseas business, the second priority measure, we have designated the Sub-Saharan Africa and Mekong River Basin regions as priority regions in light of their extremely high growth potential over the medium and long term. In the year ended March 31, 2014, the GM Strategy Committee conducted extensive and multifaceted discussions regarding Sustainability the Company’s market strategies and systems for advancing these strategies. In addition, the committee formulated region-specific initiative policies, such as for emerging countries, and examined the potential market impacts of free-trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as well as other attempts to erase economic borders. As for priority regions, we strengthened our operating systems in Myanmar, a country of special interest within the Mekong River Basin region, by greatly expanding our staff in this country. Furthermore, market strategy committees have been established for other priority regions, such as ASEAN, China, India, South America, CIS, and Sub-Saharan Africa. These committees advanced specific strategies in their respective Corporate Governance regions, and were successful at strengthening relationships with prominent local companies by dispatching committee representatives and deepening collaboration between business divisions. As for the third key measure—further top management-led human resources strategy—we continued to strengthen human resources through an approach that emphasizes “experience,” “assessment and incentives,” and “training.” At the same time, the HR Strategy Committee allocated human resources in an optimal manner that took into account the management resource allocation policies formulated by the other two strategic committees. In the year ended March 31, 2014, we instituted rotation plans geared toward enabling employees to accumulate a diverse range of work experience, developed practical training systems, and enhanced selective training programs designed for fostering future managerial candidates. Financial Progress in New Investments As stated, we aim to conduct new investments amounting to approximately ¥1.1 trillion over the three-year period of GC2015. This amount excludes the acquisition of Gavilon Holdings, LLC. Investments will be conducted in accordance with the Company-wide portfolio strategy formulated by the PM Strategy Committee, and will place aggressive asset replacement as its first priority. Major natural resources-related group investments conducted in the year ended March 31, 2014, included phased invests in the Roy Hill Iron Ore Project in Australia and the Antucoya Copper Mine in Chile. In machinery, we acquired power generation assets in Portugal, comCorporate Information menced participation in a U.S. spar-type floating oil and gas production and processing service platform project, and invested in an aircraft leasing business. In food and lifestyle products, meanwhile, we acquired NEC Mobiling, Ltd., of Japan. Furthermore, the payment of approximately US$2.7 billion for the acquisition of Gavilon Holdings was completed in July 2013. * From the year ended March 31, 2014, the Company is preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

The plan targets profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent* in the range of ¥250.0 billion to ¥300.0 billion for its final year, and ¥210.0 billion for its first, the year ended March 31, 2014, which we accomplished with profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent* of ¥210.9 billion. The final-year target for the consolidated net debt–equity ratio is approximately 1.5 times and the first-year target was approximately 1.7 times, which we also met with a ratio of 1.62 times. The final-year target for ROE of 15% or more stably has already been accomplished with Business ROE of 16.64%. While we did fall short of the final-year target for ROA of 4% or more, with actual ROA of 3.16%, measures targeting improved asset efficiency will be advanced going forward. Nonetheless, we still got off to a good start, and are now positioned to achieve or even exceed all goals in the plan’s final year, and will push forward with measures to accomplish this. Target Management Indicators Performance in the Year Management Indicator Target Ended March 31, 2014 Profit for the year attributable Year ending March 31, 2016: Sustainability ¥210.9 billion to owners of the parent* ¥250.0–¥300.0 billion Consolidated As of March 31, 2016: 1.62 times net debt–equity ratio Approx. 1.5 times ROE Equal to or more than 15% stably 16.64% ROA Equal to or more than 4% 3.16% Corporate Governance To Achieve Sustainable Growth Creating Value Unique to a General Trading Company In accordance with the spirit grounded in “Fairness, Innovation and Harmony,” the Marubeni Group is proudly committed to contribute to social and economic development and to safeguard the global environment by conducting fair and upright corporate activities. This is the Marubeni Management Philosophy. In addition, all Marubeni employees are expected to act with high ethical standards in accordance with the Marubeni Corporate Principles. Furthermore, we abide by the policies of the CSR & Environment Committee, and are continually advancing initiatives to fulfill our CSR in a wide range of fields. Companies are also members of society. As such, companies are now widely expected to practice good compliance, help preserve the environment, and contribute to society. The Marubeni Financial Group is, of course, working to these ends. Examples of social contributions include setting up scholarship funds in emerging countries, providing support for social welfare organizations through the Marubeni Foundation, and volunteer activities by employees. To preserve the environment, we are working to decrease the environmental impact of our business activities. However, the expectations that our stakeholders have for Marubeni as a general trading company extend beyond these activities. The world of today is faced with countless issues. These range from issues that threaten the Corporate Information sustainable development of humanity, including global climate change and problems surrounding energy, food resources, and water resources, to more societal issues such as human rights * From the year ended March 31, 2014, the Company is preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For details, please refer to page 95. Marubeni Annual Report 2014 17 Message from the President violations and poverty. We have received comments from stakeholders stating that they expect the Marubeni Group to utilize the expertise and abilities it has fostered through its business to help resolve these social issues. To respond to these expectations, from among the countless issues present, we have identified certain particularly critical social issues, and are addressing these issues with earnest through our business activities. Going forward, we will fulfill our responsibility toward society and the environment through the continuation of CSR activities while simultaneously addressing social issues through our business activities. I am confident that these efforts will not only increase the corporate value of the Marubeni Group but also fuel its growth into the future. (Please also refer to Marubeni’s Sustainability on page 72.) Enhancement of Corporate Governance To realize ongoing improvements in corporate value, the Company is creating more robust corporate governance systems. In particular, we are working to achieve more rapid and efficient management decisions and more appropriate supervisory functions. The Company is developing a diverse range of businesses on a global scale, and this means that management decisions must be made rapidly and efficiently. To realize this type of decisionmaking, the Board of Directors consists of directors that serve concurrently as executive officers, and are therefore highly knowledgeable with regard to Marubeni’s multifaceted business. To ensure the appropriateness of supervisory functions, we have assigned dedicated staff to the Corporate Auditor Department and are fostering collaboration among the corporate auditors, the Audit Department, the independent auditors, and the corporate auditors of Group companies. The Company’s Board of Directors consists of 12 directors, two of which are outside directors, and the Board of Corporate Auditors consists of five corporate auditors, three of which are outside corporate auditors. Each of the outside directors and corporate auditors has accumulated extensive experience and insight in their respective industries, and discussions at meetings of the Board of Directors and Board of Corporate Auditors are lively, with all officers providing suggestions and advice without being confined by the Company’s corporate culture and customs. At the same time, introducing an outside perspective into management will allow for more appropriate restraint and supervisory functions. Appropriate supervisory and restraint functions are crucial to protecting the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. This is because, with the diverse range of perspectives and opinions that exist in the world, we need these functions to prevent the Company from heading down the wrong path and meeting with disaster. (Please also refer to A Message from an Outside Director on page 88.) Improvement of Corporate Value In regard to finances, Marubeni is pursuing improved corporate value by enhancing earnings bases while strengthening its financial position to the greatest extent possible. This stance has been highly evaluated by external organizations. For example, the Company was awarded the Grand Prix in the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s prestigious FY2013 Corporate Value Improvement Awards. In working toward management targets, Marubeni employs its unique management indicator Profit After Tax less Risk Asset Cost (PATRAC), which is calculated by deducting risk asset cost from profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent*. 18 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Strategy Business Sustainability Corporate Governance The PATRAC indicator was incorporated into the Company’s management systems more than 10 years ago, and is being used as a factor for consideration when making individual investment and withdrawal decisions. Going forward, this critical indicator will continue to help guide management in the pursuit of ongoing growth and the construction of a robust earnings structure and a solid financial base. (Please refer to Risk Management on page 90 for more information.) Strengthening of Compliance Systems As of March 19, 2014, Marubeni Corporation (“Marubeni”) has reached a resolution with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) of criminal charges relating to violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) with respect to alleged improper payments to Indonesian government Financial officials for a project to expand the coal-fired power plant at Tarahan, Indonesia, by adding a steam generator and auxiliaries (the “Project”). Marubeni was a member of the consortium that was awarded the contract for the Project in 2004. Marubeni has pleaded guilty to violating and conspiring to violate the FCPA, and this plea was approved by the U.S. federal district court on May 15, 2014. At Marubeni, we realize that ensuring strict compliance is a top management priority. Based on this recognition, we have been steadily improving compliance systems on an ongoing basis. In 2002, we established the Compliance Committee, which reports directly to me. In addition, we Corporate Information have compiled the Marubeni Group Compliance Manual, which specifies the standards of * From the year ended March 31, 2014, the Company is preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For details, please refer to page 95. Marubeni Annual Report 2014 19 Message from the President behavior that all members of the Marubeni Group are expected to follow, and have introduced a whistle-blowing system. In 2005, we enacted internal rules to prevent bribery and began obtaining written statements from all directors, officers, and employees that they will be adhere to the precepts found in the Compliance Manual. We obtain new statements each year. Furthermore, in May 2014 we established the Compliance Control Department as a dedicated internal organization to further reinforce Group compliance systems and prevent reoccurrence of violations. The Company realizes the severity of the Tarahan incident and the steps that led up to it. The Marubeni Group aims to continue being a responsible corporate citizen, and has therefore devoted incredible effort to strengthening its compliance systems. Going forward, we will practice strict compliance and encourage all Group employees to act with high ethical standards in their daily work. (Please refer to Compliance on page 74 for more information.) Management’s Link with Shareholders Another important social responsibility for the Company is to be humbly receptive toward feedback from shareholders and other investors. While fair and active disclosure of Company information is a given, we are going a step beyond this to respond to shareholder and investor expectations by working to secure stable revenues in any business environment, and by comprehensively raising corporate value from all perspectives, including social and environmental perspectives. The Company realizes that internal revenues should not only be employed effectively to maximize corporate value and competitiveness. Rather, we are aware of our important mission of providing shareholders with stable and continuous dividends. In order to clarify our view on shareholder returns, we employ a policy of linking dividend payments to performance from the respective fiscal year, and target a consolidated payout ratio of at least 20%. This will be our ongoing target for the foreseeable future, but we will consider raising the consolidated payout ratio, while keeping the steady progress of GC2015 as our first priority.

Marubeni is rich in monetary and information resources, and has developed corporate functions and know-how that are ideal for supporting businesses. We also have a robust network of connections. I think these tangible and intangible assets can serve as infrastructure for employees to use as they boldly pursue their dreams. As a leader at Marubeni, I want our employees to have big dreams and never falter in my belief Business that Marubeni must be the type of company that inspires its employees to dream, and enables them to realize these dreams. As is described by the “Marubeni Spirit” defined in GC2015, I want all Group employees to establish a robust corporate image that will help us to build solid relationships of trust with all manner of stakeholders. Once again, the world continues to face countless issues, such as those related to energy, resources, and food supplies. Several of these issues can be resolved by general trading companies, and it is our responsibility to do so. Furthermore, there are still vast unexplored frontiers for the Marubeni Group to pioneer, includSustainability ing regions such as Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Our business will spread seeds of prosperity in these regions, forever changing them for the better, while also driving social and economic development in Japan, and we are advancing our business with a strong sense of commitment in recognition of this. As we progress into the future, the Marubeni Group will never cease advancing on its quest to always be a good corporate citizen and a company deemed trustworthy by its stakeholders. Corporate Governance Marubeni Spirit Possess the willpower to shape the future. Relish great challenge. Value a full, free and Financial vigorous debate. Fight through hardships. Maintain a formidable sense of fairness. Corporate Information The Marubeni Spirit summarizes the corporate culture and values of the Marubeni Group and informs the attitudes and actions of its employees.

Economic growth is expected to continue in China, India, and other emerging countries, particularly those in Asia, and such growth will drive a further rise in demand for oil, coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. Similarly, Japan saw a sharp rise in LNG imports following the halt of operations of nuclear power stations after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, thereby increasing the country’s reliance on thermal power generation.

The Company began its energy business in the 1950s with its crude oil and petroleum products business, and in 1985 Business became the first Japanese company to participate in an LNG project in Qatar. Today, in addition to Qatar we are also participating in LNG projects in Equatorial Guinea, Peru, and Papua New Guinea, and are playing an important role in securing a stable and long-term supply of energy resources for consuming countries. Meanwhile, Marubeni is engaged in the trading and marketing of LNG. The Company is importing LNG to Japan and undertaking offshore trading by utilizing its trade infrastructure, such as LNG vessels, through business offices all over the world. Sustainability Looking ahead, Marubeni is committed to responding ﬂexibly to the needs of both suppliers and consumers, such as in Japan and other parts of Asia, to contribute to the energy security and economic growth of all related countries. In Japan, we are coping with changes in the energy supply–demand balance following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, and are working on securing a stable supply of LNG. Corporate Governance Financial In LNG businesses, Marubeni is engaged in the development and production of LNG projects in Qatar and other regions, and is working to participate in new natural gas projects. Marubeni also promotes the trading and marketing of LNG by utilizing its trade infrastructure, such as LNG vessels, through business offices all over the world.

Downstream Supply to the Market and Corporate Information Consumers LNG is supplied to markets after undergoing regasification and being reverted to its gaseous state. Marubeni Annual Report 2014 31 Special Feature: Value Creator Creating Value for Marubeni and Society Energy demand is expected to grow in conjunction with economic development in emerging countries, and countries worldwide are therefore strategically diversifying their energy supply sources. Also, considering the environmental benefits of LNG, it is almost guaranteed that global gas demand will continue to grow in the coming years. Currently, Marubeni’s LNGrelated businesses boast a network of 21 bases in 15 countries, including producing countries such as Qatar and Peru as well as consuming countries such as Japan and China. In addition to pursuing ongoing growth in its own businesses, Marubeni believes its LNG businesses can also help resolve social issues faced around the world. In producing countries, our LNG businesses create employment opportunities, help transmit technologies, and foster more capable workers. Meanwhile, in consuming countries we are contributing to the long-term, stable supply of energy while at the same time advancing industrial and economic development and also preserving the environment. 32 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Strategy Marubeni’s Strategy LNG demand is expected to grow in the coming years. However, this hike in demand will not Business only be seen in consuming countries such as China and India, where LNG demand is fostered by population growth and economic development. We also anticipate LNG demand to be seen in traditional oil-producing countries and gas-producing countries, which will require the introduction of LNG in order to meet their robust domestic energy demand growth. At the same time, the number of LNG consumers is constantly increasing, as represented by the shift to power generation that relies more heavily on natural gas-fired power, such as in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. In order to meet increasing demand, Marubeni is working to participate in new LNG projects in Russia, North America, and East Africa, in addition to existing projects in Qatar, Equatorial Sustainability Guinea, Peru, and Papua New Guinea. At the same time, Marubeni is engaged in expanding its trading functions, such as logistics and marketing, by utilizing intelligence from business offices all over the world. We regard our mission as contributing to the economic development of consuming countries through the expansion of our trading businesses. Furthermore, we aim to add a new element of value to our LNG businesses by bundling all functions needed for LNG operations. In this endeavor, we will leverage the Transportation Machinery Division’s fleet of 14 LNG carriers. We will also utilize the Plant Division’s floating Corporate Governance storage and regasification units (FSRUs). These floating facilities are positioned offshore of consuming regions, where they receive shipments of LNG transported by carriers from producing regions, conduct regasification on-the-spot, and then pipe the resulting natural gas to the consumer. We also aim to supply LNG to the Chemicals Division, Power Projects & Infrastructure Division, and other divisions so that we will create collective capabilities which can only be realized by a general trading company and that will contribute to Marubeni’s sustainable growth. Financial Corporate Information Marubeni Annual Report 2014 33 Special Feature: Value Creator Infrastructure—Power Generation and Water Businesses Infrastructure Power Generation and Water Businesses Rising populations and improved living standards are driving a steady increase in the demand for electricity throughout the world, subsequently resulting in a rising need for stable power supplies. Water resources, meanwhile, face certain problems, as populations are not always located in areas with easy access to water resources. This situation is further compounded by population growth and climate change, often meaning that people in emerging countries are unable to secure stable supplies of safe drinking water. These factors also create issues for resource-rich countries as water shortages have been known to impede the progress of development projects. 34 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Strategy Marubeni’s Challenge Moving quickly to respond to these trends, Marubeni began participating in overseas engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) projects for generation facilities and transmisBusiness sion lines in the electricity field during the 1960s. In the 1990s, Marubeni utilized its experience in overseas EPC projects to move into the field of overseas independent power producer (IPP) projects. In the early 2000s, the Company started its full-ﬂedged advance into the independent (water) power producer (I(W)PP) sector of the Middle East. In the years that followed, IPP projects grew increasingly more diverse, and Marubeni continued to undertake new business models and develop new technologies to keep pace with the evolution of this field. This led the Company to participate in the electricity wholesale business in the United Kingdom as well as Sustainability in renewable energy projects worldwide, domestic power producer and supplier (PPS) projects, which involve power companies of a specified scale, and power transmission businesses. Marubeni’s operations in the water field can be traced back to the 1990s with its participation in build, operate, and transfer (BOT) projects—projects that are transferred to government control after being started up and operated for a specified period. In the 2000s, the Company began taking part in concessions—projects that entail entrusting all aspects of business Corporate Governance operation, including assets and revenue rights, to private operators—in Latin America, China, the Middle East, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Going forward, Marubeni’s goal is to be a major player in the global water market, similar to its position in the electricity market. Through its power generation and water businesses, Marubeni aims to become a major global player in the public utility field. For this position, the Company will expand the scope of its business and develop its operations to achieve ongoing growth while also contributing to the social and economic development of the countries and regions in which it operates. Financial The Power Projects & Infrastructure Division aims to conduct business activities that contribute to economic growth in various countries and regions and to society as a whole. It does this by acting as a global player in the power and water segments of public infrastructure and by providing stable and safe supplies of electricity and water. The division continues to build upon its Corporate Information stable earnings base backed by a diverse portfolio and over 50 years of industry experience, while also taking on challenges in new business domains.

Marubeni Annual Report 2014 35 Special Feature: Value Creator Marubeni’s Strengths In the power generation field, Marubeni’s strength lies in the diverse portfolio of IPP projects it has undertaken, which encompasses 48 projects in 22 countries overseas. With this substantial portfolio, Marubeni has grown to become one of Japan’s largest power producers, with 10,436 MW net generating capacity worldwide (as of March 31, 2014). Furthermore, as an EPC contractor, it boasts a robust track record backed by a history of more than 50 years in this business. While building this track record, Marubeni has honed its ability to pull complicated projects together for successful execution as well as its expertise in arranging financing. The Company’s cost competitiveness has also improved. These strengths have enabled Marubeni to achieve an industry-leading position in the area of power plants. In the water field, Marubeni currently supplies water to approximately eight million people around the world. It meets their needs by investing in companies that possess desalination and sewage treatment technologies. Marubeni’s rich business experience and its supply scale have led it to participate in a wide range of water businesses, including water and sewage projects, desalination projects, and even fully integrated water businesses. By developing this multifaceted portfolio, we are effectively responding to growing water demand.

To accomplish this goal, we invest directly in power and water projects in countries worldwide, and continue to operate these facilities for periods of 20 to 30 years after they are constructed. This approach allows us to provide a stable supply of power and water while also laying roots in the regions, thereby enabling us to coexist with the surrounding communities, contributing to industrial and social development while continuing to grow. One example of our contributions can be seen in the San Roque Hydropower Plant located in the Philippines. A portion of the revenues generated by this facility is allocated to a social contribution fund, which uses these revenues to support schools, foster industries, and develop agricultural land. This project has thus proven to be a win for both the community and our business. In Chile, meanwhile, more than 1,000 employees from our water and sewage operations are contributing to local communities. One initiative advanced in this area is the provision of job training for local residents within our operating area. Moreover, a convoy of water supply trucks was dispatched immediately after an earthquake in April 2014, effectively shortening the amount of time the community had to go without water. Through these committed efforts, Marubeni is creating new value. 38 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Strategy Marubeni’s Strategy In our power business, Marubeni is expanding the scale of operations to become a truly global Business power supplier. Aiming to solidify the foundation for generating stable revenues over the long term, we are developing this business through a multifaceted approach that includes improving the operation and management of existing assets and boosting power generation efficiency. Furthermore, we will address the deregulation of the electricity market by undertaking power generation projects, providing maintenance and inspection services for power plants, and procuring fuel for power production. Our regional strategies place Asia and the Middle East at the center of operations, but also call for the diversification of power generation assets through such means as participation in renewable energy projects in Japan, Europe, and the United States. In the water business, we have continued to accumulate experience in such countries Sustainability as Qatar, Chile, and the Philippines. We are taking advantage of this experience and the Marubeni Group’s technologies to fuel an aggressive advance into markets in Southeast Asia, South America, and Europe. Marubeni will also expand operations in the Middle East, which is one of the world’s primary regions for desalination projects. Marubeni aims to instill the know-how from this business throughout the Group. For example, we have developed sewage treatment operations in Chile for approximately 15 years, starting in the 1990s. Over this period, we have continued to raise the percentage of sewage treated in our operating area to nearly 100%. Conversely, the percentage of sewage treated in the area we service in the Philippines Corporate Governance is only about 10%. Leveraging the knowledge gained in Chile, we hope to reach 100% by the late 2030s. In both the power and water businesses, close communication with partner countries is crucial. As Marubeni develops its business and solidifies its earnings bases going forward, we will continue to promote harmony and cooperation with the communities in which we operate, and will call upon the lessons of the past in doing so.

Corporate Governance Focus Empowering a Diverse Range of Employees Around the World Many of Marubeni’s diverse talents play important roles in various fields. The following is a message from a Russian woman whose work at Marubeni (Tokyo) entails aiding infrastructure development in local communities. Contributions to Local Communities Through Infrastructure Development I first learned of Marubeni and its global business as a general trading company, when I Financial was studying in Japan. The idea of working on the global stage was highly appealing to me, and it was for this reason that I decided to join the Company. At present, I am working to develop transportation infrastructure, primarily conducting railway EPC projects (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) in Latin America and making good use of my Spanish language ability along the way. A specific example would be exporting Japanese-made railcars to Venezuela and Argentina. In Venezuela, we will supply 13 trains consisting of 52 suburban-use railcars to Venezuela’s national Liudmila Vakkhova railway. These trains are anticipated to help improve Venezuela’s public transportation Transport & Infrastructure Project Dept., Corporate Information system while at the same time alleviating the chronic traffic congestion affecting the Plant Div. suburbs around Caracas. In Argentina, meanwhile, we will refurbish subway railcars used in Japan and supply these cars for use by Buenos Aires City Subway. Refurbishing used railcars means that this transportation infrastructure development project is also environmentally friendly. I feel great pride in my work knowing that I am taking part in the development of local communities. Marubeni Annual Report 2014 83 Corporate Governance A Message from the Chairman Corporate Governance for Raising Corporate Value Teruo Asada Chairman of the Board In accordance with its Company Creed of “Fairness, Innovation and Harmony,” the Marubeni Group has declared its commitment to contributing to social and economic development by conducting fair and upright corporate activities. We believe that corporate governance must form the foundation for our efforts to fulfill this mission, and have therefore positioned strengthening governance systems among our most important management priorities. To enhance the efficacy of corporate governance at Marubeni, we have thoroughly separated supervision and execution functions in management: the roles of chairman and CEO have been separated; an executive officer system has been introduced; and two outside directors have been elected to the Board of Directors in addition to three outside corporate auditors. All of these outside officers are also independent officers. In this way, we have taken measures to enhance the oversight functions of management. Furthermore, we are pursuing greater diversity and have selected a female outside director. Through these and other efforts, we are continually strengthening corporate governance. With the members I just mentioned, the Board of Directors discusses important management issues, while incorporating the objective opinions of outside officers. In the year ended March 31, 2014, the Board of Directors approved decisions to finance power generation ventures, an aircraft leasing business, a mobile handset sales agent business, and other projects. In regard to compliance, we have appointed an independent compliance consultant, and have taken other steps to strengthen relevant systems as we continually improve compliance measures. A final and complete corporate governance system does not exist. Currently, the Companies Act is being revised, and the Japanese Stewardship Code is being established. Developments such as these will surely change the playing field when it comes to corporate governance in Japan, and it can be expected that system reforms like these will also occur in the future. Marubeni will respond to these reforms positively and appropriately, actively adopting effective systems with the aim of creating an even better corporate governance system. We will continue with efforts to improve our corporate value in this way. 84 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Strategy Basic Approach to Corporate Governance In keeping with the spirit of our Company Creed of “Fairness, improvement of efficiency of business activities, accurate Innovation and Harmony” and the Marubeni Corporate reporting of earnings results to stakeholders, maintenance of Principles, the executives and employees of the Marubeni compliance with applicable laws and regulations, safeguarding Group observe relevant laws and regulations, as well as our of assets, and appropriateness of corporate activities.

A Message from an Outside Director Advice for Creating Value and Continuing Growth from a Macroeconomic Perspective The general trading company business model is indigenous to Japan, and the specifics of this business model can change greatly in response to social trends. As an outside director at Marubeni, it is important for me to give advice that will help guide the Company in responding to these trends to create value and continue growing from a macroeconomic perspective. At the same time, a basic role of mine is to help restrain the Company when necessary, to “put on the brakes,” so to speak. In the past, I have worked in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, where I was involved in the energy and trade insurance fields. From this experience, I am able to incorporate global economic trends into the advice I offer, and I therefore see offering this advice as part of my role at Marubeni. Those working at Marubeni are all exceptionally well-versed in the industries they have been placed in charge of. For this reason, I provide input about how businesses will be affected by such trends as global market conditions, growing populations in emerging countries, and the declining and aging of Japan’s population. General trading companies face constantly changing operating environments, and this means that their corporate governance systems need an extra element of flexibility paired with Takao Kitabata lightning-fast decision-making. I feel confident in saying that Marubeni’s governance systems Outside Director are superior in both of these respects. I can also offer praise for the speed exercised in most of the discussions among the Board of Directors. The Marubeni Group has overcome the risks borne out of countless social changes to realize the strong performance it boasts today. One of Marubeni’s strengths is its earnings structure that is balanced between the natural resource and non-natural resource fields, which I feel is a major factor behind the stability of the Company’s performance. In this rapidly changing social environment, I believe that Marubeni has unmeasurable potential. Going forward, as we discuss various projects, I will actively offer advice rooted in my experience at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and other positions and based on the information gained through the networks I have formed through these positions. 88 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Strategy Roles and Functions of Outside Corporate Auditors Outside corporate auditors monitor the directors’ execution Committee of Executive Officers.

Corporate Governance Financial Corporate Information 9 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 117 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Business Overview Marubeni Corporation (the “Company”) is a corporation domiciled in Japan. The Company and its domestic and overseas subsidiaries, which are controlled by the Company mainly through direct or indirect holdings of the majority of voting rights (together the “Companies”), engage in import and export trades of domestic and overseas products and commodities, including domestic and offshore trades in fields which cover extensive types of commodities such as agri-marine products, chemicals, energy, metals, machinery, textile, forest products and general merchandise, paper and pulp, finance, logistics, information industry, development and construction and others. In addition, the Companies offer various services and engage in diversified business such as investments in domestic and foreign businesses, exploration of natural resources and others. The translation of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts for the year ended March 31, 2014 and at March 31, 2014 is included solely for the convenience of readers outside of Japan and has been made at ¥103 to $1, the exchange rate prevailing on March 31, 2014. The translation should not be construed as a representation that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 2. Basis of Presentation (1) Statements of Compliance The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. As the Company meets the requirements of a “Specified Company”, pursuant to Article 1-2 of the Ordinance on Terminology, Forms and Preparation Methods of Consolidated Financial Statements (Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance No. 28 of 1976, the “Consolidated Financial Statements Ordinance”), it has applied the provisions of Article 93 of said Ordinance. (2) Functional Currency and Presentation Currency The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are presented in Japanese yen, the functional currency of the Company, and amounts of less than one million yen are rounded to the nearest million yen. (3) Use of Estimates and Judgments Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make accounting estimates and assumptions, as necessary that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions due to their inherent uncertainty. Accounting estimates and assumptions that could significantly affect the Consolidated Financial Statements are as follows: ・ Write-down of inventories (Note 5 “Inventories”) ・ Impairment of property, plant and equipment, and investment property (Note 6 “Property, plant and equipment”, Note 8 “Investment property”) ・ Impairment of intangible assets (Note 7 “Intangible assets”) ・ Provisions (Note 9 “Provisions”) ・ Defined benefit obligation (Note 12 “Employee benefits”) ・ Recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 14 “Income taxes”) ・ Impairment of investments in associates and joint ventures (Note 15 “Associates and joint ventures”) ・ Valuation of financial instruments (Note 16 “Financial instruments and related disclosures”) ・ Contingent liabilities (Note 25 “Commitments and contingent liabilities”) Information related to judgments made by the Company that could significantly affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in the process of applying the accounting policies are as follows: ・ Scope of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (Note 3 “Significant accounting policies”) ・ Accounting for leases (Notes 11 “Leases”) ・ Derecognition of financial assets (Note 16 “Financial instruments and related disclosures”) 10 118 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 3. Significant Accounting Policies Strategy (1) Basis of Measurement The Consolidated Financial Statements, as stated in the accounting policies below, have been prepared on an historical cost basis, with the exception of certain current assets, financial instruments, and assets and liabilities relating to the post-employment benefit plan, which are measured at fair value. (2) Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of all domestic and foreign subsidiaries under the control of the Company either through direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest or by other means. Intercompany Business transactions and accounts between the Companies are eliminated. To align the reporting periods of subsidiaries that have a financial year end that is different from the financial year end of the Company (March 31) due to unavoidable reasons such as compliance with the local legal system of the country in which they operate, subsidiaries prepare additional financial statements as of the financial year end date of the Company and similar such adjustments. (3) Business Combinations The Companies use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations. The acquisition cost is the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value, plus any previously held equity interest in the acquiree remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The amount of any non-controlling Sustainability interest is measured as elected for each business combination either at fair value or at the proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree. Any difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the equity interest in the acquiree previously held at the time control is obtained is recognised in profit or loss. Further, any other comprehensive income that had been previously recognised in connection with the equity interest in the acquiree is treated in the same way as a disposal of the equity interest. Acquisition costs incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The Companies perform any necessary classification and designation of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based, in principle, on the contractual terms, economic conditions, business or accounting policies, and other appropriate Corporate Governance conditions that exist on the acquisition date. (4) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Associates refer to investees over which the Companies have the ability to exercise significant influence through such factors as the ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting interest in the entity and other factors. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the Companies, as the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The Companies account for investments in associates and joint ventures under the equity method. Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are normally recorded at cost, adjusted for the Companies’ share of the change in the net assets of these associates and joint ventures since the acquisition date. Any dividends received from these associates and joint Financial ventures are subtracted from the carrying amount of investments in associates and joint ventures. The Companies’ share of the profit or loss of the associates and joint ventures is included as “Share of profit of associates and joint ventures” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Companies’ share of any change in other comprehensive income recognised by the associates and joint ventures is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any unrealised profit arising from the transactions between the Companies and the associates and joint ventures is eliminated against the Companies’ interest in associates and joint ventures. Certain adjustments are made to achieve unification of the accounting policies of the associates and joint ventures with those of the Companies. Corporate Information To align the reporting periods of associates and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method that have a financial year end that is different from the financial year end of the Company (March 31) due to unavoidable reasons such as the relationship with other shareholders, the associates and joint ventures prepare additional financial statements as of the financial year end date of the Company and similar such adjustments. 11 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 119 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) If it is determined, after the initial application of the equity method to investments in associates and joint ventures, that there is objective evidence of impairment based on all available information, the carrying amount of investments in associates and joint ventures is reduced to their recoverable amounts and the difference is recognised in profit or loss as an impairment loss. The Companies determine, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that the recognised impairment loss may no longer exist or may have been reduced. If there is such an indication, the Companies estimate the recoverable amount of investments in associates and joint ventures. If the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, a reversal of impairment losses is recognised in profit or loss to the extent of the increase in the recoverable amount of the investment since the recognition of impairment losses, and is recognised only up to the amount of impairment losses that have been recognised in the past. If the Companies lose significant influence or joint control over any associates and joint ventures, such investments in associates and joint ventures are measured at fair value. Specifically, the difference between; the fair value of any residual interests plus the proceeds from the partial disposal of interests in associates or joint ventures, and the carrying amount of the investment at the date on which control was lost, is recognised in profit or loss. Any other comprehensive income previously recognised under the equity method is accounted for in the same manner as a disposal of assets or liabilities related to the other comprehensive income of the associates and joint ventures. (5) Foreign Currency Translation The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Companies are presented in Japanese yen, the functional currency of the Company. Each entity in the consolidated group determines its functional currency in consideration of, among other factors, the economic environment in which it operates, and it measures the items in its financial statements using its own functional currency. Assets and liabilities included in the financial statements of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at the reporting date rates. Income and expenses are translated at the average rates prevailing for the reporting period. The resulting translation adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income and the cumulative translation adjustments are recognised in other components of equity. On disposal of a subsidiary that results in loss of control, all cumulative translation adjustments related to the foreign operation that have been recognised in other components of equity are reclassified to profit or loss. In a partial disposal of a subsidiary that does not result in loss of control, the corresponding share of the cumulative translation adjustment that has been recognised in other components of equity is reclassified to non-controlling interest rather than profit or loss. On disposal of an associate or joint venture that results in loss of significant influence or loss of joint control, the full amount of the cumulative translation adjustment that has been recognised in other components of equity is reclassified to profit or loss. In a partial disposal of an associate or joint venture that does not result in loss of significant influence or loss of joint control, the corresponding proportionate share of the cumulative translation adjustment that has been recognised in other components of equity is reclassified to profit or loss. (6) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Companies include deposits in banks and certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity of 3 months or less at the acquisition date in cash equivalents. (7) Financial Instruments (i) Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets to which IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”) applies are classified as follows: debt instrument financial assets are classified as either financial assets measured at amortised cost or financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (“Financial assets measured at FVTPL”), and equity financial assets are classified as either Financial assets measured at FVTPL or financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“Financial assets measured at FVTOCI”). The Companies determine such classifications at initial recognition of the financial assets. 12 120 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Financial assets measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value at initial recognition and financial assets other than Financial Strategy assets measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value plus transaction costs at initial recognition. For purchases or sales of financial assets under contracts with terms requiring delivery of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned (regular way purchase or sale), the purchase or sale is recognised on the trade date on which the Companies become a party to the contract for the financial asset. Financial assets of the Companies include cash and cash equivalents, debt instrument financial assets including notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, equity financial assets, and derivative financial assets. Subsequent measurement Business After initial recognition, financial assets are measured according to their category as follows: Financial assets measured at amortised cost A debt instrument financial asset is measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: ・ The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and ・ The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. After initial recognition, a debt instrument financial asset for which these conditions are satisfied is measured at amortised Sustainability cost calculated using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. Amortisation using the effective interest method is recognised as part of finance income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Companies may, at initial recognition, make an irrevocable election to designate a financial asset that meets the conditions for classification as measured at amortised cost mentioned above as Financial assets measured at FVTPL, if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. Financial assets measured at FVTPL Corporate Governance The Companies classify the following financial assets as Financial assets measured at FVTPL: (i) equity financial assets not designated as Financial assets measured at FVTOCI at initial recognition and (ii) debt instrument financial assets that either do not meet the conditions for classification as measured at amortised cost or those that meet these conditions but are designated as Financial assets measured at FVTPL under an election made by the Companies at initial recognition. After initial recognition, changes in the fair values of financial assets classified as Financial assets measured at FVTPL, together with the related dividend and interest income, are mainly recognised as part of finance income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Financial assets measured at FVTOCI The Companies make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to (or not to) designate equity financial assets that are not held for trading as Financial assets measured at FVTOCI. Financial After initial recognition, equity financial assets designated as Financial assets measured at FVTOCI are measured at fair value with any change in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount of the change in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other components of equity. However, dividend income arising from equity financial assets designated as Financial assets measured at FVTOCI is recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Corporate Information 13 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 121 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Derecognition The Companies derecognise a financial asset in the following situations: ･ When the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset are extinguished; ・ When the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset are transferred or when the Companies retain their contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assume a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more of the ultimate payees without significant delay under a pass-through arrangement and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the transferee; and ・ When the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset are transferred or when the Companies retain their contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assume a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more of the ultimate payees without significant delay under a pass-through arrangement and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are neither transferred nor retained, but control over the financial asset is transferred. Where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are neither transferred nor retained and control over the transferred financial asset is retained, the Companies continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of their continuing involvement. When Companies continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of their continuing involvement, any liabilities arising in relation to such continuing involvement are recognised. The continuing involvement in the financial asset and any liabilities arising in relation to such continuing involvement are measured on the basis of the rights and obligations held by the Companies. Impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost The Companies judge that a financial asset measured at amortised cost is impaired only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occur after the initial recognition of the asset, and such an event or events have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Objective evidence of impairment includes such events as significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor and a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments. The amount of an impairment loss is estimated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate or observable market prices of the financial asset. However, if the returns on the financial asset are based on a floating interest rate, the present value of estimated future cash flows is calculated using the effective interest rate at each reporting date. In addition to the impairment losses recognised in the manner described above, the Companies recognise impairment losses on financial assets based on historical credit loss rates calculated in consideration of past experience, etc. or estimated recoverable amounts after evaluating potential risks associated with the obligors, geographic areas, etc. pertaining to the financial assets. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position by deducting them directly from the carrying amount of the respective assets in the case of debt securities and by recognising an allowance in the case of financial assets other than debt securities. Impairment losses arising from trade receivables are recognised as part of selling, general and administrative expenses and those arising from other assets are recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed either directly or by adjusting an allowance account. Such a reversal is recognised to the extent that it does not result in the financial asset having a carrying amount that exceeds what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised at the date the impairment is reversed. The amount of reversal of impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. 14 122 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (ii) Financial liabilities Strategy Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities to which IFRS 9 applies, are classified as follows: financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost unless they are financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss (“Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL”). The Companies determine such classifications at the initial recognition of the financial liabilities. Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value at initial recognition and financial liabilities classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are measured at fair value less transaction costs at initial recognition. Business Financial liabilities of the Companies include corporate bonds and loans payable, notes and trade accounts payable, derivative financial liabilities, etc. Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured according to their classification as follows: Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL Financial liabilities designated as Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value. After initial recognition, changes in the fair values of Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL together with the related Sustainability interest expense are mainly recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. However the amount of changes in the fair value of the financial liabilities that attributable to changes in the credit risk of the entity is recognised as other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Financial liabilities not classified as Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost. After initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortisation using the effective interest method is recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Corporate Governance Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Derecognition The Companies derecognise a financial liability only when the underlying obligation specified in the contract is performed, discharged, cancelled or expires. An exchange of financial liabilities with substantially different terms or a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as the derecognition of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability, and the difference between the carrying amount of these liabilities is recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Financial guarantee contracts The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries, in the normal course of their business, issue various guarantees for Financial obligations owed by associates and general trade partners (“guaranteed parties”). These are issued to third parties to guarantee the repayment, mainly of loans which the guaranteed parties have borrowed from external parties. When a guaranteed party fails to perform its obligations, the Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries are obligated to perform the obligations in accordance with the relevant financial guarantee contract. Liabilities recognised for such financial guarantee contracts are measured at initial recognition at the present value of the total guarantee premiums to be received by the guarantor over a future period under the financial guarantee contract adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, these liabilities are amortised over the financial guarantee period Corporate Information on a systematic basis and the amortised amounts are recognised in profit or loss. However, if the estimated amount required to settle any such current guarantee obligations at the reporting date exceeds the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, the balance of any such liability is recognised at the estimated amount required to settle such current guarantee obligations at the reporting date, and any resulting difference is recognised in profit or loss. 15 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 123 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (iii) Offsetting of financial instruments A financial asset and a financial liability are offset and the net amount is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Companies currently have a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intend either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. (iv) Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments at the end of each reporting period is measured based on the market price in an active market. If the market in which a financial instrument is traded is not active or no active market exists for the financial instrument, fair value is determined by using an appropriate valuation technique. (8) Derivatives and hedge accounting Initial recognition and subsequent measurement The Companies recognise derivatives as assets or liabilities at fair value. For derivatives designated as qualifying hedging instruments, subsequent changes in fair value are recognised according to the objective and designation of the hedge. Subsequent changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as qualifying hedging instruments are recognised in profit or loss. Fair value hedge If the objective of holding a derivative is to hedge the exposure of changes in the fair value of the hedged item (as a fair value hedge), changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised in profit or loss and are offset against the changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments. When financial instruments measured at amortised cost are designated as hedged items, after recognising the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of such hedged items in profit or loss, the adjusted financial instruments are amortised through profit or loss using the recalculated effective interest rate. The Companies use fair value hedges mainly for hedging the exposure of changes in the fair value of goods or firm commitments to purchase goods and the exposure of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities with a fixed interest rates arising from changes in interest rates. Cash flow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, which are held to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows of the hedged items, are recognised in other components of equity until changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recognised in profit or loss. However, the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised in profit or loss. The Companies use cash flow hedges for hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows of forecast purchases of goods, sales of goods, etc. arising from changes in prices and exchange rates and the exposure to variability in interest cash flows of a floating rate interest bearing assets and liabilities arising from changes in interest rates. The amounts that have been recognised in other components of equity relating to such hedging instruments are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. However, if a hedged item is a recognised non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts that have been recognised in other components of equity relating to the hedging instrument are reclassified as adjustments to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. If a forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the Companies discontinue the hedge accounting. Accordingly, any amounts that had been recognised in other components of equity while the hedge was effective are reclassified to profit or loss when hedge accounting is discontinued. Changes in the fair value of the derivative after hedge accounting is discontinued are recognised in profit or loss prospectively as it is no longer a hedging instrument. However, to the extent that such a previously hedged forecast transaction continues to be expected to occur even if hedge accounting is discontinued, amounts that had been recognised in other components of equity before the discontinuation of hedge accounting remain in other components of equity until the forecast transaction occurs. 16 124 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation Strategy Where the objective of holding a derivative and other non-derivative hedging instruments, such as loans payable, is to hedge the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation (as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation), changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments attributable to changes in exchange rates are recognised in other components of equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. Of the changes in the fair values of derivative and other non-derivative hedging instruments which are due to exchange rate movements, the portions related to any ineffectiveness or any parts outside the hedge effectiveness assessment are recognised in profit or loss. The cumulative amount of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments attributable to changes in exchange rates that have been recognised in other components of equity under a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is reclassified to profit or Business loss when the underlying foreign operation is disposed of. (9) Inventories Inventories, which mainly consist of commodities, merchandise, and real estate held for sale, are measured at the lower of cost (mainly specific or moving average cost) and net realisable value. If the net realisable value is lower than cost, the difference is expensed as a write-down and the amount of the write-down is directly deducted from the carrying amount of inventories. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Sustainability When the cause of a write-down no longer exists, or when there is clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value due to changes in economic conditions, reversals of such write-downs are recognised. The carrying amount after reversal is recognised at the lower of cost or the revised net realisable value, and the amount of the reversal of write-downs is recognised in profit or loss. Inventories held for generating profits from short-term fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value less costs to sell, with fluctuations in fair value less costs to sell recognised in profit or loss in the period in which such fluctuations occur. Corporate Governance (10) Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are recognised initially at acquisition cost including transaction costs. Acquisition cost includes borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, etc. of assets requiring a considerable time period before they can be used as intended. The present value of the estimated costs for the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment at the end of its useful life is included in the acquisition cost of the item if the recognition criteria for provisions are met, and are recognised as an expense through depreciation over the useful life of the item. After initial recognition, the Companies apply the cost model to items of property, plant and equipment and measure such assets at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. The depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment is allocated over each period for the useful life of each item through depreciation, mainly on a straight-line basis over the useful life of each item (buildings and structures from 2 to 60 years, machinery and equipment from 2 to 45 years), or the units of production method based on reserve estimation. Land is not depreciated. If an item of property, plant Financial and equipment includes one or more significant parts, each significant part is individually depreciated. The Companies derecognise an item of property, plant and equipment when they have disposed of it or when it is no longer expected to produce any future economic benefits through use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of the item and its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss when the item is derecognised. The basis of depreciation of property, plant and equipment, such as residual value, useful life, and depreciation method, is Corporate Information reviewed at each reporting date. When there is a change in the basis of depreciation, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate. 17 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 125 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (11) Investment property Investment property is property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both. An investment property is recognised initially at acquisition cost including transaction costs. Acquisition cost includes borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, etc. of assets requiring a considerable time period before they can be used, or sold, as intended. The present value of the estimated cost of disposal of an investment property at the end of the useful life is included in the acquisition cost of the investment property if the recognition criteria for provisions are met, and are expensed through depreciation over the useful life of the investment property. After initial recognition, the Companies apply the cost model to investment properties and recognise them at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. The depreciable amount of investment properties is allocated as an expense over each period for the useful life of each property through depreciation, mainly on a straight-line basis (buildings and structures from 2 to 60 years). Land is not depreciated. The Companies derecognise an investment property when they have disposed of it or when it is no longer expected to produce any future economic benefits through use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of the property and its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss when the property is derecognised. The basis of depreciation of investment properties, such as residual value, useful life, and depreciation method, is reviewed at each reporting date. When there is a change in the basis of depreciation, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. (12) Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at initial recognition at acquisition cost. The acquisition cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combinations is measured at the acquisition date fair value. After initial recognition, the Companies apply the cost model to intangible assets and measure such assets at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Internally generated intangible assets are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, unless they satisfy the criteria for capitalisation. Intangible assets are classified as either intangible assets with finite useful lives or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. The amount of intangible assets with finite useful lives subject to amortisation is allocated as an expense over each period for the useful life of each asset (franchises and customer relationships approximately from 3 years to 45 years, software approximately from 2 years to 20 years) through amortisation, mainly on a straight-line basis. The basis of amortisation of these intangible assets, such as useful life and depreciation method, is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. When there is a change in the basis of amortisation, the amortisation charge is adjusted prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. Intangible assets judged to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation, and the Companies review, at the end of each reporting period, whether the events or circumstances supporting such a judgment continue to exist. If the judgment that the useful life is indefinite is no longer valid, the intangible asset is reclassified from an intangible asset with an indefinite life to an intangible asset with a finite useful life, with amortisation charges adjusted prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate. The Companies derecognise an item of intangible assets when they have disposed of it or when it is no longer expected to produce any future economic benefits from its use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of an intangible asset arising from its derecognition and its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. 18 126 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Goodwill Strategy Goodwill is recognised as the excess of (a) the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value, the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree remeasured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the aggregate amount of consideration”) over (b) the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The amount of non-controlling interest is measured for each business combination either at acquisition date fair value or at the acquirer’s proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree. If the total amount of consideration is less than the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary, the difference is recognised in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is measured at acquisition cost less accumulated Business impairment loss. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, on or after the acquisition date, allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to receive benefits from the business combination. If an operation within a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is disposed of, the portion of goodwill related to the operation to be disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation for the purpose of calculation of the disposal gain or loss. Goodwill is allocated on the basis of the relative percentage of the values of the business to be disposed of and the remaining portion of the cash-generating unit, unless there is a more reasonable method. Sustainability (13) Oil, gas and mineral resources mining activities Costs associated with the exploration, evaluation and development of oil and gas are accounted for based on the successful efforts method. Costs associated with the acquisition of vested mining rights, costs associated with the drilling and construction of exploratory wells and development wells, and related facilities are capitalised; and costs associated with exploratory wells are expensed when it has been demonstrated that the wells have no commercial viability, while other costs associated with exploration and evaluation, including geographical survey costs, are recognised as expenses when incurred. Costs associated with the exploration and evaluation of mineral resources are recognised as an expense as they are incurred until such time as the Corporate Governance commercial viability of the mining activities is demonstrated. Capitalised costs associated with exploration, evaluation and development are recognised as property, plant and equipment (machinery and equipment). Additionally, expenditures associated with the acquisition of rights to explore, etc. are recognised as intangible assets (licenses and operating rights for natural resources), and reclassified as property, plant and equipment (machinery and equipment) when their technical feasibility and economic viability have been demonstrated. When facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount, such carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount. (14) Leases The Companies engage in the business of leasing non-current assets as lessors and lease non-current assets as lessees under finance leases and operating leases. Whether or not an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is determined at the inception of the lease based on the substance of Financial that arrangement considering whether the performance of that arrangement depends on the use of a specific asset or group of assets, and whether the right to use the asset is transferred under the terms of that arrangement. Accounting as lessee For finance leases that transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset, an asset and a liability are recognised on the commencement of the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset, determined at the inception of the lease, or the present value of the minimum lease payments Corporate Information calculated at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the outstanding liability, and finance charges are calculated so that they are equivalent to a constant interest rate on the balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised as expenses over the lease term and contingent rents are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Leased assets are depreciated over the period of expected use by a method consistent with the depreciation method for other similar assets owned by the lessee. The period of expected use is the useful life of the asset if the transfer of ownership is reasonably certain, or the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset if the transfer of ownership is not reasonably certain. 19 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 127 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern by which the user of the asset obtains benefits from use of the asset. Contingent rents are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Accounting as lessor For finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset, a lease receivable is recognised on the commencement of the lease term at an amount that equals the net investment in the lease at the inception of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred by the lessor are recognised as part of net investment in the lease in principle. For operating leases, the leased assets are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position according to the nature of the assets and are depreciated by a method consistent with the depreciation method for other similar assets owned by the lessor. Lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern by which the user of the asset obtains benefits from use of the asset. Initial direct costs incurred by the lessor are included in the carrying amount of the leased asset and are recognised as expenses over the lease term as corresponding lease income is recognised. (15) Impairment of non-financial assets other than inventories Impairment losses The Companies assess, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Property, plant and equipment, investment property, and intangible assets with finite useful lives: If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill: If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The Companies also evaluate whether the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount on a regular basis (at least annually), irrespective of whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal sell and its value in use. This determination is made for individual assets, unless an individual asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and that reduction is recognised as an impairment loss. The value in use is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at a discount rate reflecting the time value of money and the current market evaluation of the risks inherent in the asset. Reversals of impairment losses The Companies assess, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is an indication that the recognised impairment losses in prior periods for an asset may no longer exist or may have decreased. If there is such an indication, the Companies estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. If the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, a reversal of impairment losses is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount after the reversal does exceed the carrying amount (after deducting accumulated depreciation or accumulated amortisation) that would have been determined had the impairment losses not been recognised previously. Reversal of impairment losses is recognised in profit or loss. However, impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed under any circumstances. (16) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations The Companies classify a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the following conditions are met: ・ It is available for immediate sale in its present condition based solely on usual or customary conditions; and ・ Sale is highly probable. 20 128 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) A non-current asset or disposal group classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value Strategy less costs to sell. Depreciation or amortisation is discontinued for a non-current asset or disposal group for the year in which it is classified as held for sale. (17) Provisions The Companies recognise a provision when (i) they have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and (iii) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount Business of a provision is measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation, discounted at a discount rate reflecting the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance expenses. For decommissioning obligations, a provision is recognised for the costs of demolition or removal of the asset, land restoration costs and expenditures incurred as a result of the use of the asset, and is added to the acquisition cost of the asset. Estimated costs and the discount rate applied are reviewed every year and any adjustment to the estimated amount is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. The effect of changes in estimated costs or the discount rate applied is added to or deducted from the carrying amount of the related asset. Sustainability (18) Post-employment benefits The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and lump-sum severance indemnity plans covering substantially all employees. The Companies measure the present value of defined benefit obligations and the post-employment benefit costs based on the projected unit credit method for each plan. The effect of the remeasurement of a net defined benefit asset or liability is recognised in other comprehensive income and is immediately reclassified from other components of equity to retained earnings. Such remeasurement consists of actuarial gains Corporate Governance and losses on the defined benefit obligation and the return on plan assets (excluding the amount of interest income on plan assets). Past service cost is recognised immediately in profit or loss. A net defined benefit asset or liability is calculated as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets and is recognised as an asset or liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. (19) Treasury stock If the Companies buy back their own equity instruments (treasury stock), such treasury stock is recognised at acquisition cost and is deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss at the time of purchase, sale, issuance or retirement of treasury stock. The difference between the carrying amount and the sale proceeds is recognised in capital surplus. (20) Revenue Financial Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Such a fair value is calculated after deducting sales discounts, volume rebates, etc. The Companies are involved in various forms of transactions including proprietary transactions and agency transactions. In agency transactions, consideration for the transaction is settled directly between the ultimate buyer and the seller, and the Companies receive fees from the buyer, the seller or both. Proprietary transactions, agency transactions, etc. are carried out in the following forms. Corporate Information Sale of goods Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied: ・ The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer; ・ Neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold is retained; 21 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 129 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) ・ The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; ・ It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and ・ The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. In the case of a sale of goods, if the Companies arrange shipping or deliver a bill of lading, warehouse receipt, delivery order, etc., to the buyer, revenue is recognised when the delivery obligations specified in the contract have been performed, such as when said document is delivered or when the inspection of goods is completed, and there are substantially no further obligations to perform, and the receipt of goods by the customer is practically certain. Rendering of services When the outcome of the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period. The Companies judge that the outcome of the rendering of services can be estimated reliably if all the following conditions are satisfied: ・ The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; ・ It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; ・ The stage of completion of the transaction can be measured reliably at the end of the reporting period; and ・ The costs incurred for the transaction or the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably. In the case of rendering of services, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised that are recoverable, unless the outcome of the rendering of services can be estimated reliably. In acting as an agent, the Companies recognise commissions when contracted services are fully rendered to the customers. Construction contracts When the outcome of the construction contract can be reliably estimated, the percentage of completion method is applied. Under the percentage of completion method, contract revenue is recognised progressively over several accounting periods as work is performed representing the proportionate completion of the contract. The Companies judge that the outcome of the construction contract can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied: ・ The total amount of contract revenue can be measured reliably; ・ It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the entity; ・ Both the contract costs to complete the contract and the stage of contract completion at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and ・ The contract costs attributable to the contract can be clearly identified and measured reliably so that actual contract costs incurred can be compared with prior estimates. When the outcome of the construction contract cannot be reliably estimated, contract revenue is recognised to the extent recovery of contract costs incurred is probable. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the excess amount is recognised immediately as an expense. Presentation of the total amount of revenue and the net amount of revenue The Companies are deemed to be performing transactions as a principal when they have exposure to the significant risks and rewards associated with the sale of goods or the rendering of services, and the total amount of transactions is presented as revenue. The Companies are deemed to be performing transactions as an agent when they do not have exposure to the significant risks and rewards associated with the sale of goods or the rendering of services, and the net amount, after deduction of amounts due to third parties from the consideration earned on the transactions, is presented as revenue. “Total volume of trading transactions” includes all transactions involving the Companies regardless of transaction type. “Total volume of trading transactions” is not required by IFRSs but is presented here to provide readers with a better understanding and is as presented in common Japanese accounting practice. 22 130 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Interest income Strategy Interest income is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Companies and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive the dividends is established. (21) Income and other taxes Current tax Business Taxes payable (receivable) at the end of each reporting period are measured at an amount expected to be due for payment to, or refunded from, the taxation authorities. In measuring the amount of taxes, the Companies use the statutory tax rate or statutory effective tax rate at the end of each reporting period. Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income, whereas current tax related to items recognised directly in equity is recognised directly in equity. The Companies recognise the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on technical interpretations, that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset and if the Companies currently have a legally enforceable right to set Sustainability off the recognised amounts of the assets and liabilities and intend either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised by the Companies based on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and their tax basis, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and tax laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Corporate Governance Deferred tax liabilities are recognised with respect to taxable temporary differences other than those arising in the following cases: ・ Initial recognition of goodwill; ・ Initial recognition of assets or liabilities arising from a transaction that is not a business combination and does not affect accounting profit or taxable profit (loss) at the time of the transaction; and ・ Taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, and associates or interests in joint ventures if the parent, investor or party to a joint venture is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences, tax loss carryforwards, and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference, etc. can be utilised, except for deferred tax assets arising from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities arising from transactions that are Financial not a business combination and which do not affect accounting profit or taxable profit (loss) at the time of the transaction which are not recognised. For deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates or interests in joint ventures, a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Corporate Information The Companies review, at the end of each reporting period, whether it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to realise part or all of the benefit of the deferred tax assets, and reduce the amount of deferred tax assets to the extent that it is no longer probable that such taxable profit will be available. The Companies also review unrecognised deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period and recognise them to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will be available. 23 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 131 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented as non-current assets and non-current liabilities, respectively. Deferred tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income, whereas deferred tax related to items recognised directly in equity is recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset and presented net if, and only if, the Companies currently have a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and either of the following two conditions is met: ・ The deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity; and ・ The deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on different taxable entities, and those entities intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period. Consumption taxes Revenues, cost, and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income do not include consumption taxes.

Employee Benefits (1) Post-employment benefits Strategy The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries have cash balance plans based on the Japanese Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan Act and other defined benefit pension plans. These plans cover substantially all employees other than directors. In addition to the pension plans, the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries have lump sum retirement plans to be paid upon retirement or severance based on the years of service and compensation level. The Company, pursuant to the Japanese Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan Act and other laws, has the obligation to make contributions to the Marubeni Corporate Pension Fund (the “Fund”), which pays out pension benefits. The Director of the Fund has the fiduciary duty to comply with laws, the dispositions of the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare made pursuant to Business laws, the bylaws of the Fund and the decisions of the Board of Representatives, and to faithfully perform duties for the Fund including the management and operation of the contributions. Additionally, a code of conduct has been articulated, which prohibits the Director of the Fund from entering into asset management agreements for the purpose of benefiting a third party and from acts that constitute conflicts of interest. The pension plan is operated by the Fund, which is legally independent from the Company. The Board of Representatives comprises an equal number of Representatives elected from the management side (Assigned Representatives) and Representatives elected from the employee side (Mutually Elected Representatives), while the chair of the Board of Representatives (the “Chairman”) is elected from the management side. Proceedings of the Board of Representatives are decided by a majority vote of the members attending. In the case of a tied Sustainability vote, the Chairman has the power to decide the vote. However, with regard to particularly important matters, the bylaws provide that the decision be made by a majority that exceeds the above. The Representatives hold exclusive power to decide important matters including investment policy. The actual management of the assets is conducted by investment managers on the basis of an entrustment contract, and the Representatives are prohibited by law from giving instructions, such as instructions on specific investments. The Company is required to make contributions to the Fund, and the contributions are reviewed regularly to the extent allowed by law. While it is under obligation to make contributions stipulated by the Fund into the future, the Company, in addition to these contributions, also funds a retirement benefit trust on a voluntary basis. Corporate Governance With regard to the lump sum retirement plan, the Company is under obligation to pay benefits directly to the beneficiaries. Although the Company is not under any legal obligation regarding the funding of this plan, fund assets exist, which have been voluntarily contributed by the Company to the retirement benefit trust. Financial Corporate Information 39 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 147 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets of the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Thousands of U.S. Millions of yen dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Balance at beginning of year of net defined benefit Liability ¥67,404 ¥66,437 $654,408 Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation: Balance at beginning of year 282,345 247,212 2,741,214 Current service cost 10,251 8,213 99,524 Past service cost 271 158 2,631 Interest expense 5,458 6,384 52,990 Remeasurements: Actuarial gains (losses) arising from changes in demographic assumptions 4,346 (1,958) 42,194 Actuarial gains (losses) arising from changes in financial assumptions (2,601) 27,100 (25,252) Other 750 64 7,281 Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 6,229 7,578 60,476 Benefits paid (21,636) (13,750) (210,058) Effects of business combinations and divestitures 6,938 1,344 67,359 Balance at end of year ¥292,351 ¥282,345 $2,838,359 Changes in the fair value of the plan assets: Balance at beginning of year ¥214,941 ¥180,775 $2,086,806 Interest income 4,575 4,968 44,417 Remeasurements: Return on plan assets 8,872 14,339 86,136 Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 5,395 5,743 52,379 Employees’ contributions 3,918 368 38,039 Employer’s contributions 3,003 20,310 29,155 Benefits paid (19,471) (12,346) (189,039) Effects of business combinations and divestitures 2,417 784 23,466 Balance at end of year 223,650 214,941 2,171,359 Balance at end of year of net defined benefit liability ¥68,701 ¥67,404 $667,000 Actuarial assumptions used for the present value calculation of the defined benefit obligations at March 31, 2014 and 2013 were mainly as follows: March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 Discount rate 1.3% 1.3% Rates of salary increase 4.8% 4.8% Sensitivity analyses are conducted at the year end based on reasonably estimable changes in assumptions. Although sensitivity analyses assume that the actuarial assumptions other than those that are subject to the analyses are held constant, in reality, it is possible for the sensitivity analyses to be impacted by other actuarial assumptions. If, for example, the discount rate rose by 0.5%, and the other assumptions were held constant, the defined benefit plan liability at March 31, 2014 and 2013 would decrease by ¥11,463 million ($111,291 thousand) and ¥11,190 million, respectively. The rate of salary increase is not expected to change. 40 148 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Fair value of plan assets by class at March 31, 2014 was as follows: Strategy Millions of yen With a quoted Without a quoted market price in an market price in an Class of plan assets active market active market Total Cash and cash equivalents ¥15,160 ¥– ¥15,160 Equity securities: Japanese companies 34,801 – 34,801 Pooled funds 1,398 57,735 59,133 Debt securities: Business Bonds denominated in Japanese yen – 13,372 13,372 Pooled funds – 80,612 80,612 Life insurance company general accounts – 14,393 14,393 Other 1,930 4,249 6,179 Total plan assets ¥53,289 ¥170,361 ¥223,650 Thousands of U.S. dollars With a quoted Without a quoted Sustainability market price in an market price in an Class of plan assets active market active market Total Cash and cash equivalents $147,184 $– $147,184 Equity securities: Japanese companies 337,874 – 337,874 Pooled funds 13,573 560,534 574,107 Debt securities: Bonds denominated in Japanese yen – 129,825 129,825 – Corporate Governance Pooled funds 782,641 782,641 Life insurance company general accounts – 139,738 139,738 Other 18,738 41,252 59,990 Total plan assets $517,369 $1,653,990 $2,171,359 Fair value of plan assets by class at March 31, 2013 was as follows: Millions of yen With a quoted Without a quoted market price in an market price in an Class of plan assets active market active market Total Cash and cash equivalents ¥66,315 ¥– ¥66,315 Financial Equity securities: Japanese companies 32,624 – 32,624 Pooled funds 1,100 32,725 33,825 Debt securities: Bonds denominated in Japanese yen – 12,671 12,671 Pooled funds 716 54,813 55,529 Life insurance company general accounts – 10,732 10,732 Other 1,515 1,730 3,245 Corporate Information Total plan assets ¥102,270 ¥112,671 ¥214,941 In making investment decisions, the main objective is to secure the necessary return over the long term to cover pension and retirement benefit payments. The primary investment policy is to analyse the risk/return characteristics by asset class and to invest in a diversified portfolio taking into consideration the correlation among asset classes. 41 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 149 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The Company sets an asset mix policy with investments in equity securities, debt securities and other assets. Based on this policy, the Company selects multiple investment managers who execute the strategy. When selecting an investment manager, the Company gives consideration to management philosophy and content, investment management policy and investment style, investment control systems including information collection mechanisms and decision-making processes, compliance systems, investment experience and the track record of the investment manager as well as the professionals in charge of managing pension assets. Plan assets are invested 30%, 60% and 10% in equity securities, debt securities and other, respectively, at March 31, 2014. The investments executed by investment managers are outlined as follows: Equity securities are selected mainly from stocks that are listed on securities exchanges. Prior to investing, the Company investigates the business conditions of the investee companies and appropriately diversifies investments by type of industry and other relevant factors. Debt securities are selected mainly from government bonds, public debt instruments and corporate bonds. Prior to investing, the Company investigates the quality of the issuing conditions, including issuers, rating, interest rate and repayment dates, and appropriately diversifies the investments. Pooled funds are selected using strategies consistent with the equity and debt securities described above. For investments in life insurance company general accounts, contracts with insurance companies include a guaranteed interest rate and a return of capital. With respect to foreign investments vehicles, the Company investigates the stability of the underlying governments and economies, the market characteristics, such as settlement systems, and the taxation systems. For each such investment, the Company selects the appropriate investment country and currency. The performance of certain plan assets by the cash balance plan is matched with the related pension benefits to a certain extent. Funding of the Marubeni Corporate Pension Fund is conducted by taking into account various factors including limits on deductible expenses under the tax rules, the funding status of plan assets and actuarial calculations. Contributions to plan assets are intended to cover benefits for services to be rendered by employees in the future as well as services already rendered. In accordance with the Japanese Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan Act, the bylaws of the Marubeni Corporate Pension Fund provide for the re-calculation of the contribution amount at five-year intervals with the year end as the base date for the purpose of maintaining balanced finances into the future. The re-calculation process reviews the basic rates relating to the contribution (the guaranteed rate of return, expected rate of mortality, expected withdrawal rate, expected salary increase, expected new enrollment rate, etc.) and verifies the adequacy of the contribution amount. Additionally, the Company, in order to ensure sufficient funding of the pension plan, may also contribute marketable equity securities and cash to the retirement benefit trust in the amount of the unfunded portion of the defined benefit obligation. The amount of contributions expected to be paid to the plan assets for the year ending March 31, 2015 is approximately ¥7,600 million ($73,786 thousand). The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at March 31, 2014 and 2013 was 14.6 years. (2) Employee benefit cost The aggregate amounts of employee benefit cost included under “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were ¥260,428 million ($2,528,427 thousand) and ¥213,972 million, respectively. 13.

Fines of ¥8,976 million ($87,146 thousand) in loss were included in “Other-net” for the year ended March 31, 2014. Fines represent the loss as a result of resolution with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) in relation to the Indonesia Tarahan Project. 42 150 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 14. Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated income tax return in Japan. Strategy Total income taxes recognised for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were attributable to the following: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars 2014 2013 2014 Current tax ¥14,803 ¥(42,848) $143,718 Deferred tax (37,890) 20,102 (367,864) Total ¥(23,087) ¥(22,746) $(224,146) Business The Company is mainly subject to income tax, inhabitants tax and enterprise tax, which is recognised as a deductible expense, and the applicable income tax rate calculated on the basis of these taxes for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately 38%. However, the income tax rates of foreign subsidiaries are calculated on the basis of general local tax rates. On March 31, 2014, the Act to Partially Revise the Income Tax Act (Act No. 10 of 2014) was promulgated, according to which the Special Corporation Tax for Reconstruction will no longer be imposed from the financial years beginning April 1, 2014 and thereafter. As a result of this amendment, the applicable tax rate will be reduced from approximately 38% to 36% effective the financial year beginning April 1, 2014. The impact of these changes in tax rates on the financial position and results of operation of the Companies was immaterial.

The share of comprehensive income consisted of ¥39,401 million in profit for the year and ¥3,908 million in other comprehensive income. 45 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 153 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The share of losses of associates and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method for which recognition was discontinued amounted to ¥32,597 million (of which ¥6,163 million increases for the current year). This unrecognised share of losses mainly consisted of remeasurement losses on cash flow hedges executed by joint ventures. Certain associates and joint ventures procure funds through project financing, and impose restrictions on the use of cash deposits. 16. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures (1) Policy for managing capital The fundamental policy of the Companies is to maintain an optimal mix of funding in line with the requirements of the asset portfolio. Funding sources include indirect financial procurement firstly from banks and other financial institutions, as well as direct procurement through the issuance of bonds, commercial paper and other means. The Companies utilise such management indicators as net D/E ratio (Note 1) and risk assets (Note 2) and strengthen the financial base to establish a strong earnings structure and a solid financial footing that can withstand changes in the business environment while attaining sustainable growth. Note 1 Net D/E ratio = Consolidated net interest bearing debt / Total consolidated equity. Consolidated net interest bearing debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits from the total bonds and borrowings (current and non-current). Note 2 The Company defines risk assets as the exposure of its portfolio to the maximum possible loss that could be incurred on a consolidated basis, measured using the Value at Risk method. The Company conducts computer simulations on all group assets including the assets of the consolidated subsidiaries that take into account the risk attributes of each type of exposure such as country risk, industry risk, credit rating of the customers, and scheduled due dates of receivables. At the group level, management regularly monitors the net D/E ratio, which is targeted at approximately 1.5 times by the end of the year ending March 31, 2016 under the three-year mid-term management plan, “Global Challenge 2015”, which commenced April 2013. The Companies are not subject to any significant capital restrictions (with the exception of general restrictions pursuant to laws such as the Companies Act of Japan). (2) Policy for managing risks The Companies conduct business activities in various countries including Japan and are, thus, subject to the effects of interest rate risks, exchange rate risks, credit risks, commodity price risks, liquidity risks and stock price fluctuation risks described below. The Companies evaluate these risks through monitoring on a regular basis. (i) Management of interest rate risks The Companies, as a result of procuring loans at floating interest rates, are subject to the effects of changes in future cash flows of financial instruments caused by the fluctuation of market interest rates; while, as a result of procuring loans at fixed interest rates, are subject to the effects of changes in the fair value of financial instruments caused by the fluctuation of market interest rates. Through asset-liability management, the Companies utilise interest rate swaps and other agreements to mitigate interest rate risks. Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the impact of a 1% rise in interest rates on the profit before tax of the Companies at March 31, 2014 and 2013 assuming that all other variables are held constant. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Effect on profit before tax ¥(16,626) ¥(9,993) $(161,417) 46 154 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (ii) Management of foreign currency risks Strategy The Companies conduct transactions in a variety of currencies and are, thus, subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuation risks associated with business activities conducted in foreign currencies and with net investments in foreign operations. In order to hedge the risks associated with business activities, i.e., the risk of changes in cash flows of foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, firm commitments and forecast transactions, and the risk of changes in fair value of foreign currency denominated receivables, payables and firm commitments; as well as the exchange rate fluctuation risk of net investments in foreign operations, the Companies utilise forward-exchange contracts, foreign currency denominated bonds and borrowings, currency swaps and other means to mitigate these risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign exchange sensitivity Business The following table illustrates the impact of an appreciation of the Japanese yen by ¥1 against the US$ and AU$ on profit before tax and equity of the Companies, assuming that all other variables are held constant at March 31, 2014 and 2013. A depreciation of the Japanese yen by ¥1 against the US$ and AU$, assuming that all other variables are held constant, would result in the opposite impact on the profit before tax and equity of the Companies of the amounts shown in the following table. Currencies other than the US$ and AU$, there are no foreign currencies that pose a significant exchange rate fluctuation risk. Thousands of U.S. Millions of yen dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Sustainability <U.S. dollars> Effect on profit before tax ¥300 ¥(273) $2,913 Effect on foreign currency translation adjustments (before tax) (6,696) (6,199) (65,010) <Australian dollars> Effect on profit before tax 31 5 301 Effect on foreign currency translation adjustments (before tax) (1,055) (831) (10,243) (iii) Management of credit risks Corporate Governance The Companies carry out general trading business, which comprise export, import, domestic and offshore trading in a wide variety of fields including industrial, agricultural and consumer products, and which also involves all levels of activities from planning, investment, and research and development through production, distribution and marketing. In addition, the Companies operate in substantially all geographic areas of the world, and their customers are diversified. Accordingly, management of the Companies believes there is no significant concentration of credit risk among its customers or in its investments. The Companies require collateral to the extent considered necessary. The carrying amount of the financial assets of the Companies after impairment represent the maximum exposure to credit risk that does not take into account collateral and other credit enhancements. (iv) Management of commodity price risks The Companies are subject to the effects of fluctuation risk of oil and gas, coal, aluminum, copper, and agricultural product Financial prices. The Companies match buy and sell orders and use commodity derivatives including commodity futures, commodity forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity options to mitigate the fluctuation risks of commodity prices. Additionally, certain commodity derivatives are entered into for trading purposes within pre-determined limits and loss limits. Commodity price sensitivity The fluctuation risk of commodity prices is substantially diminished through commodity derivatives and other means. Additionally, the impact of changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives for trading purposes is not significant. Corporate Information (v) Management of liquidity risk The Companies are subject to the effects of liquidity risk including the dramatic decline in liquidity of held assets due to financial market turmoil. The Companies maintain a sufficient level of liquidity, mainly in the form of cash and deposits, in addition to cash flows from operating activities and the establishment of commitment lines with financial institutions. 47 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 155 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The following table illustrates the results of a liquidity analysis conducted on the derivatives of the Companies at March 31, 2014 and 2013. Derivatives that are settled net with other contracts are represented as gross amounts.

(vi) Management of stock price fluctuation risk The Companies hold equity instruments (stocks) mainly for the purpose of strengthening relationships with business partners and are, thus, subject to the effects of stock price fluctuations. The Companies regularly review their holding of stocks, and by disposing of stocks that are no longer considered worthwhile holding, mitigate the risk of fluctuations in stock prices. Sensitivity to stock price fluctuations In terms of equity instruments (stocks) in active markets, if quoted prices drop 5% across the board at the year end, the negative impact (before tax) on “Gains (losses) on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income” of the Companies for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 would be ¥(7,089) million ($(68,825) thousand) and ¥(6,331) million, respectively; while the impact on profit or loss would be minimal. (3) Fair value of financial instruments (i) Fair value measurement methods The estimated fair value of the financial instruments of the Companies has been determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. The following methodologies and assumptions were used by the Companies in estimating the fair value disclosures of financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits: Cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits were measured at amortised cost, and their carrying amount in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position approximated fair value due to the relative short-term maturities. Investment securities and other investments: The fair value of investment securities in active markets is measured on the basis of quoted prices at the year end. The fair value of equity financial assets in markets that are not active and debt instrument financial assets classified as Financial assets measured at FVTPL is measured on the basis of discounted future cash flows, third-party valuations and other valuation methods. The fair value of debt instrument financial assets measured at amortised cost is estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the market interest rates at the year end applicable to debt instrument financial assets with identical remaining periods and similar credit ratings. 48 156 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, and notes and trade accounts payable: The fair value of notes, trade accounts Strategy and loans receivable, and notes and trade accounts payable is estimated using discounted future cash flows based mainly on the interest rates at the year end applicable to notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, and notes and trade accounts payable with identical remaining periods and similar credit ratings. Bonds and borrowings: The fair value of bonds and borrowings is estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the interest rates at the year end applicable to similar loan agreements with identical remaining periods. Other financial assets and liabilities: Other financial assets and other financial liabilities included derivative assets and derivative liabilities. Business The carrying amounts of derivative assets and derivative liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position represent fair value. Non-derivative assets mainly consisted of other receivables from customers, and have been measured at amortised cost, with the exception of Financial assets measured at FVTPL. Non-derivative liabilities mainly consisted of other payables to customers and payables relating to consideration for notes, trade accounts and loans receivable that have been transferred without satisfying the criteria for derecognition of financial assets, and have been measured at amortised cost. The carrying amounts of non-derivative assets and non-derivative liabilities measured at amortised cost reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position approximated fair value. Sustainability Interest rate swap agreements: The fair value of interest rate swap agreements is estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the swap rates at the year end applicable to similar interest rate swap agreements with identical remaining periods. Forward exchange contracts: The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is estimated based on quoted prices at the year end. Commodity futures and forward contracts: The fair value of commodity futures and forward contracts is estimated based on quoted prices at the year end. Corporate Governance (ii) Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable The carrying amounts of notes, trade accounts and loans receivable at March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Notes receivable ¥89,610 ¥95,859 $870,000 Trade accounts receivable 1,400,021 1,290,049 13,592,437 Loans receivable 117,285 96,730 1,138,689 Allowance for doubtful accounts (36,253) (30,152) (351,971) Total ¥1,570,663 ¥1,452,486 $15,249,155 Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable subsequently measured at FVTPL have been classified as such based on the Financial Company’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset, while all other notes, trade accounts and loans receivable are substantially measured at amortised cost. Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable measured at FVTPL were ¥72,631 million ($705,155 thousand) and ¥20,049 million at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The carrying amounts of notes, trade accounts and loans receivable measured at amortised cost approximated their fair value at March 31, 2014. The fair value of notes, trade accounts and loans receivable measured at amortised cost was ¥1,434,655 Corporate Information million at March 31, 2013. 49 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 157 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable that were transferred without meeting the criteria for derecognition at March 31, 2014 and 2013 were ¥117,981 million ($1,145,447 thousand) and ¥88,372 million, respectively, and have been included in “Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable” correspondingly the amounts credited from the transfer of ¥81,670 million ($792,913 thousand) and ¥58,064 million, respectively, have been included in “Other current financial liabilities”. In terms of these notes, trade accounts, and loans receivable, the Companies have been judged to substantially retain all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred assets, as the Companies assume payment obligations in the event of default by the drawer or the obligor. Additionally, certain notes, trade accounts and loans receivable transferred continue to be recognised as assets to the extent of continuing involvement, due to the Companies assuming partial payment obligations in the event of a default by the obligor or due to the Companies having been determined to retain control over the said notes, trade accounts and loans receivable. At March 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying amounts prior to transfer of the said notes, trade accounts and loans receivable were ¥702 million ($6,816 thousand) and ¥569 million, respectively, and the carrying amounts of assets continued to be recognised by the Companies due to continuing involvement and the related liabilities in the same amounts were ¥120 million ($1,165 thousand) and ¥107 million, respectively. Of the amounts above, notes, trade accounts and loans receivable for which the transferee has the right to recourse only for the transferred assets were ¥98,528 million ($956,583 thousand) and ¥72,288 million, and the carrying amount of the related liabilities were ¥62,220 million ($604,078 thousand) and ¥41,980 million at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These carrying amounts approximate the fair values. Changes in allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Balance at beginning of year ¥30,152 ¥38,969 $292,738 Provision for the year 3,971 2,975 38,553 Charge-offs (9,236) (12,154) (89,670) Others 11,366 362 110,350 Balance at end of year ¥36,253 ¥30,152 $351,971 Impairment of notes, trade accounts and loans receivable is recognised when there is objective evidence of impairment, and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate falls below the carrying amount. Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable for which impairment was recognised at March 31, 2014 and 2013 were ¥34,531 million ($335,252 thousand) and ¥27,570 million, respectively; and their corresponding allowances for doubtful accounts were ¥29,903 million ($290,320 thousand) and ¥22,994 million, respectively. The Companies have determined that the difference between the carrying amounts of the notes, trade accounts and loans receivable and their respective allowances will be recoverable through the collection of collateral and other means. The Companies, as part of their accounts receivable management policy, consider financing receivables 90 days past due as delinquent and strengthen procedures over collection. Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable that were past due but not impaired at March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Not later than 90 days ¥75,923 ¥79,015 $737,116 Later than 90 days 18,006 23,896 174,816 Total ¥93,929 ¥102,911 $911,932 50 158 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (iii) Investment securities and other investments Strategy The carrying amounts of investment securities and other investments at March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Investment securities FVTPL ¥– ¥– $– Amortised cost 0 949 0 Total ¥0 ¥949 $0 Other investments FVTPL ¥11,495 ¥14,452 $111,602 Business FVTOCI 432,664 413,942 4,200,621 Amortised cost 22,465 21,919 218,107 Total ¥466,624 ¥450,313 $4,530,330 Debt “Investment securities” and “Other investments” subsequently measured at FVTPL have been classified as such based on the Company’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

(vii) Fair value measurements The Companies measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The inputs used in the fair value measurement are categorised Financial into three levels based upon the observability of the inputs in markets. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Companies can access at the measurement date Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities Corporate Information 55 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 163 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value by the Companies on a recurring basis at March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Non-derivative Financial assets measured at FVTPL: Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable ¥– ¥72,631 ¥– ¥72,631 ¥– ¥20,049 ¥– ¥20,049 $– $705,155 $– $705,155 Investment securities – – – – – – – – – – – – Other Investments (equity) – – 113 113 – – 152 152 – – 1,097 1,097 Other Investments (debt) – – 11,382 11,382 – – 14,300 14,300 – – 110,505 110,505 Other financial assets – – 13,834 13,834 – – 11,732 11,732 – – 134,311 134,311 Non-derivative Financial assets measured at FVTOCI: Other Investments 141,776 1,025 289,863 432,664 126,617 1,005 286,320 413,942 1,376,466 9,951 2,814,204 4,200,621 Derivative instruments: Interest rate contracts – 20,601 – 20,601 – 26,787 – 26,787 – 200,010 – 200,010 Forward exchange contracts – 13,550 – 13,550 – 22,496 – 22,496 – 131,553 – 131,553 Commodity contracts 1,250 48,481 663 50,394 11,891 16,198 203 28,292 12,136 470,689 6,437 489,262 Other – – – – 14 – – 14 – – – – Liabilities: Derivative instruments: Interest rate contracts – (1,701) – (1,701) – (3,372) – (3,372) – (16,515) – (16,515) Forward exchange contracts – (15,567) – (15,567) – (11,815) – (11,815) – (151,136) – (151,136) Commodity contracts (10,055) (32,733) (152) (42,940) (4,717) (17,445) (207) (22,369) (97,621) (317,796) (1,476) (416,893) Other – – – – (5) – – (5) – – – – Other investments categorised as Level 1 mainly consist of marketable equity securities in active markets. Derivative instruments categorised as Level 1 mainly consist of derivatives related to commodity contracts. These assets are measured at quoted prices in active markets without adjustment. Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable categorised as Level 2 consist of notes and trade accounts receivable that are settled at future market prices; and other investments categorised as Level 2 consist of equity securities traded on markets that are not active. Derivative instruments categorised as Level 2 mainly consist of interest rate swaps, forward exchange contracts and derivatives related to commodity contracts. These assets and liabilities are mainly measured based on quoted prices of identical assets not categorised as Level 1 in markets that are not active or similar assets or liabilities in active markets, and measurement is based mainly on a market approach using observable inputs, such as prices in commodity markets, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Other investments categorised as Level 3 mainly consist of equity securities in active markets; and derivative instruments categorised as Level 3 consist of derivatives related to commodity contracts. These assets and liabilities are measured mainly based on an income approach using inputs that are reasonably available or inputs many market participants use with reasonable confidence because observable inputs are not available due to a lack of similar assets or liabilities in active markets or distortive market prices resulting from dramatic liquidity decreases and such like. Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of investments whose fair values are measured on a recurring basis categorised as Level 3 are operating profit growth rates and discount rates. Fair value increases (decreases) as operating profit growth rate rises (declines); and decreases (increases) as the discount rate rises (declines). Operating profit growth rates used in fair value measurement by the Companies range from +0.2% to +15.2%, and discount rates used in fair value measurement range from 1.4% to 13.0%. 56 164 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Strategy The Companies recognise transfers of assets and liabilities between Levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of each quarterly period. During the year ended March 31, 2014, there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.

Additionally, “Other” above mainly consists of “Foreign currency translation adjustments” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The relevant division of the Company, upon determining the valuation method of the applicable assets and liabilities, measures the fair value of assets and liabilities categorised as Level 3, according to valuation policies and procedures stipulated by the Company. Additionally, appropriate third-party valuations are obtained, as necessary. The results of fair value measurements are then reviewed by the Corporate Staff Division, which is independent from the division responsible for the fair value measurement. If the inputs used to measure “Other investments measured at FVTOCI” among the assets categorised as Level 3 were to be changed, the fair value would decreased by ¥24,613 million at March 31, 2013. This difference in fair value was mainly due to changes in commodity prices and the discount rate. At March 31, 2014, there were no significant change of the fair value. 58 166 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (4) Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities At March 31, 2014 and 2013, among the financial assets and financial liabilities recognised with the same counterparty, the Strategy financial instruments offset in accordance with the criteria for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities and the financial instruments not offset as a result of not meeting some or all of the offsetting criteria despite being subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, were as follows: Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Gross amounts of recognised financial assets ¥120,063 ¥73,555 $1,165,660 Business Amounts offset in accordance with the criteria for offsetting of financial assets and liabilities (47,114) (17,083) (457,417) Net amount presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 72,949 56,472 708,243 Amounts not offset due to not meeting some or all of the offsetting criteria for offsetting financial assets and liabilities despite being subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement (55,172) (43,472) (535,651) Net amount ¥17,777 ¥13,000 $172,592 Sustainability Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 Gross amounts of recognised financial liabilities ¥127,006 ¥77,315 $1,233,067 Amounts offset in accordance with the criteria for offsetting of financial assets and liabilities (47,114) (17,083) (457,417) Net amount presented in the Consolidated Statement of Corporate Governance Financial Position 79,892 60,232 775,650 Amounts not offset due to not meeting some or all of the offsetting criteria for offsetting financial assets and liabilities despite being subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement (55,172) (43,472) (535,650) Net amount ¥24,720 ¥16,760 $240,000 Generally, the set-off rights on financial instruments that do not meet some or all of the offsetting criteria for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities become enforceable only under special circumstances, such as when the counterparty can no longer fulfill its obligations due to bankruptcy and other reasons. Financial (5) Derivative instruments and hedging activities Fair value hedges The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries mainly designate, as fair value hedges, currency swap agreements, which hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, and foreign currency denominated firm commitments; commodity futures and forward contracts, which hedge volatility risk of the fair value of inventories and firm commitments on commodity transactions; and interest rate swaps, which convert fixed interest rates on assets and liabilities to floating interest rates. Corporate Information For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, gains (losses) on hedging instruments in fair value hedges were net gains of ¥2,933 million ($28,476 thousand) and net losses of ¥(1,760) million, respectively. Gains (losses) on the hedged items more or less corresponded to the gains (losses) on hedging instruments. For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant amounts recognised in profit or loss relating to the ineffective portion of hedges or portions excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Additionally, there were no significant amounts recognised in profit or loss due to firm commitments becoming ineligible as hedged items. 59 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 167 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Cash flow hedges The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries mainly designate, as cash flow hedges, forward exchange contracts, which hedge the cash flows of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, foreign currency denominated firm commitments and foreign currency denominated forecast transactions; interest rate swaps, which convert floating interest rates on assets and liabilities to fixed interest rates; and commodity futures and forward contracts, which hedge the cash flows of forecasted transactions on commodity transactions. For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant amounts recognised in profit or loss relating to the ineffective portion of hedges or portions excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Additionally, there were no significant amounts of gains (losses) on cash flow hedges reclassified to profit or loss because the forecast transactions no longer were expected to occur. For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, amounts recognised as gains (losses) on cash flow hedges (before tax) were net gains of ¥15,167 million ($147,252 thousand) and ¥10,748 million, respectively.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries enter into long-term purchase contracts for certain goods and products in metal and machinery industries at either fixed or variable prices. The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries generally enter into sales contracts for such purchase contracts with customers. The total amounts of the long-term purchase contracts were approximately ¥784,000 million ($7,611,650 thousand) and ¥611,000 million at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries had commitments to make additional investments or loans in the aggregate amounts of approximately ¥325,000 million ($3,155,340 thousand) and ¥379,000 million at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of which capital expenditures in property, plant and equipment were approximately ¥71,000 million ($689,320 thousand) and approximately ¥81,000 million, respectively, while commitments to joint ventures were approximately ¥124,000 million ($1,203,883 thousand) and approximately ¥140,000 million, respectively. The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries provide various types of guarantees for the obligations of their associates and customers in the ordinary course of business. The guarantees mainly relate to the repayment of borrowings to third parties. Should the guaranteed associates and customers fail to fulfill their obligations, the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries would be required to fulfill the obligations under these guarantees. Outstanding guarantees were ¥329,647 million ($3,200,456 thousand) and ¥299,347 million, including ¥194,159 million ($1,885,039 thousand) and ¥203,603 million to associates and joint ventures, at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Outstanding guarantees (total of guarantee payable) represent the maximum potential amount of future payments under the contracts without any consideration of the likelihood of such obligations being incurred. Therefore, such amounts do not represent the anticipated losses on these guarantees and indemnifications, and they greatly exceed anticipated losses. Some guarantees are secured by counter guarantees provided for the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries by third parties. The amounts of counter guarantees provided for the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries by third parties were ¥24,044 million ($233,437 thousand) and ¥22,559 million, including ¥22,516 million ($218,602 thousand) and ¥17,175 million relating to the associates and joint ventures at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The liabilities recognised for the guarantees were ¥1,435 million ($13,932 thousand) and ¥1,084 million at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company manages the risk of fulfillment of obligations under the guarantees by setting the appropriate line of credit and by undertaking provisional measures in accordance with the credit risk rank to which each guaranteed customer belongs. The Company determines the rank of each customer before entering into the guarantee agreements according to the customer’s credit risk which is estimated and reviewed based on the customer’s financial information. The likelihood of such obligations being incurred under the guarantees which would have a material effect in the Consolidated Financial Statements were estimated to be remote at March 31, 2014. A provision for loss on guarantees was recognised for the amount that was considered probable. The Companies conduct business activities on a global scale and are involved in transactions which are subject to the oversight by various types of authorities, both in Japan and abroad. Such business activities are exposed to risk and, from time to time, may involve legal actions, claims or other disputes. Although there were various issues outstanding at March 31, 2014, management is of the opinion that settlement of all such issues outstanding would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. 74 182 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 26. Structured Entities The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries hold subordinated investment securities and other interests without voting Strategy rights in structured entities engaged in real estate developments, and include such structured entities in their scope of consolidation.

Total assets of these unconsolidated structured entities at March 31, 2014 and 2013 were ¥441,094 million ($4,282,466 thousand) and ¥441,718 million, respectively. These structured entities mainly procure funds through bank loans.

Terms of Engagement Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd. (LRQA) was commissioned by Marubeni Corporation (MARUBENI) to provide independent assurance on its environmental indicators within its Annual Report 2014 for the fiscal year 2013, that is, 01 April 2013 to 31 March 2014 (“the Report”) to a limited level of assurance using LRQA’s verification procedure and ISO 14064–3:2006 Specification with guidance for validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions. LRQA’s verification procedure is based on current best practice and uses the principles of AA1000AS (2008) Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Reliability of performance data and processes defined in ISAE3000. Our assurance engagement covered MARUBENI’s operations and activities at the six main offices1 in Japan and specifically the following requirements:  Confirming that the Report is in accordance with MARUBENI’s in-house reporting procedures, and  Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the selected environmental indicators within the Report. The environmental indicators are defined as: Electricity consumption and its associated CO2 emissions City gas consumption and its associated CO2 emissions Steam consumption and its associated CO2 emissions Fuel consumption and its associated CO2 emissions Amount of generated wastes and the amount recycled from each waste stream2 Water consumption3 Paper consumption, and Green product procurement rate. Note 1: The six main offices include the head office in Tokyo, and office branches in Hokkaido, Shizuoka, Nagoya, Osaka and Kyushu. Note 2: General waste data was not available and excluded for office branches in Osaka, Nagoya, Kyushu and Hokkaido. Note 3: Water consumption data was not available and excluded for office branches in Nagoya, Kyushu and Shizuoka. Our assurance engagement excluded all operations and activities of MARUBENI and its associated companies, other than those specified above in Note 1, CO2 emissions from transportation activities and mobile sources, and the data and information of its suppliers, contractors and any third-parties mentioned in the Annual Report 2014. LRQA’s responsibility is only to MARUBENI. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. MARUBENI’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of MARUBENI. LRQA’s Opinion Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that MARUBENI has not:  Met the requirements above, and  Disclosed accurate and reliable environmental indicators. The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier. Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. LRQA’s Approach LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with LRQA’s verification procedure and ISO 14064-3 for greenhouse gas data. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:  Assessing MARUBENI’s approach to stakeholder engagement to confirm that issues raised by stakeholders were captured correctly. We did this through reviewing MARUBENI’s stakeholder engagement processes and Annual Report 2013.  Reviewing MARUBENI’s process for identifying and determining material issues to confirm that the right environmental issues were included in their Report. We did this by benchmarking reports written by MARUBENI and its peers to ensure that sector specific issues were included for comparability. This document is subject to the provision on page 2. 198 Marubeni Annual Report 2014 Strategy  Auditing MARUBENI’s data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or mis-statements in the Report. We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling procedures, instructions and systems, including those for internal verification. We also spoke with those key people responsible for compiling the data and drafting the Report.  Visiting the Tokyo head office to confirm the data collection processes, record management practices, and to Business physically check its electricity and gas meters, steam utilizing and monitoring facilities, emergency power generator equipment and fuel oil tank. Observations Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:  Stakeholder inclusivity: We are not aware of any key stakeholder groups that have been excluded from MARUBENI’s stakeholder engagement process.  Materiality: We are not aware of any material issues concerning MARUBENI’s environmental indicators that have been excluded from the Report.  Responsiveness: Sustainability MARUBENI has processes and systems for disclosing its environmental indicators in its Annual Report and corporate website. However, we believe that MARUBENI should consider widening the scope for disclosure and report on its environmental indicators of interest to overseas stakeholders, not just to local ones.  Reliability: MARUBENI has established a well-defined and centralised system to collect and calculate its environmental indicators. MARUBENI also carries out an internal data verification process at the head office to ensure the accuracy of the reported data. LRQA’s Competence and Independence LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent. Corporate Governance LRQA is MARUBENI’s certification body for ISO 14001 and verifier for the Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Emission Trading Scheme. The verification and certification assessments are the only work undertaken by LRQA for MARUBENI and as such do not compromise our independence or impartiality.
