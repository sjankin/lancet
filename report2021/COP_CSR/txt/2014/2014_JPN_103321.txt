This policy sets forth the priority initiatives that Mizuho will undertake in fiscal 2014. Mizuho’s Aim of “Bringing Fruitfulness for Each Customer and the Economies and the Societies in which We Operate” For us to fulfill our basic mission as a financial institution and “perform our functions as financial intermediaries” in a stable manner, we have to be one step ahead at all times, taking account of changes in society and the economy. Doing this, we will be able to continue to contribute to regional economies and the recovery of the Japanese economy, and the name “Mizuho” (as in Japanese) will symbolize the “bringing fruitfulness” that we can offer to our customers, the economy, and society. As the Group moves forward together in “bringing fruitfulness,” it will continue to develop and increase its corporate value. As Mizuho moves forward as a financial institution to fulfill its social mission, we ask for the ongoing support of all our stakeholders. July 2014 5 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Matters Related to Elimination of Transactions with Anti-Social Elements Regarding Administrative Orders from the FSA MHBK received the business improvement order from the Financial Services Agency (FSA) with respect to transactions with anti-social elements in relation to certain captive loans on September 27, 2013, and MHFG and MHBK received the business improvement order (including MHBK to cease transaction of certain captive loans in part) from the FSA on December 26, 2013. Based on the business improvement order, MHFG and MHBK submitted business improvement plans to the FSA on October 28, 2013 and January 17, 2014, respectively. MHFG has always positioned severing ties with anti-social elements as one of its most important management issues. We have been focusing on preventing and terminating such transactions as those with anti-social elements. Nevertheless, we gravely accept the highly regrettable fact that our framework to prevent and sever relationships with anti-social elements was inadequate for certain captive loans. We have steadily implemented improvement measures pursuant to the business improvement plan including further enhancement of frameworks to sever relations with anti-social elements and improvement of corporate culture. Our specific efforts are as follows. Improvement measure frameworks 1. Measures to Prevent Recurrence ―Elimination of anti-social element transactions for the captive loans (loans through captive aﬃliates)― ・Termination of captive loans with anti-social elements ・Increase stringency of entry checks of anti-social elements ・Increase stringency of post-entry checks of anti-social elements ・Introduce a clause to exclude anti-social elements in loan agreements used in the Captive Loan Scheme Measures to prevent recurrence (captive loan measures) A plan formulated with a focus on the increasing expectations of society regarding severing ties with anti-social elements Structural Reforming enhancements awareness, etc. (management (heightening structure, awareness, organization) improving corporate culture) 2.

In addition, through the preparation of its Fiscal CSR Initiative Policy, which is linked with its Medium-Term Business Plan, Mizuho is working to strengthen its CSR management. Basic Approach toward CSR Initiatives In its Basic Policy on CSR Initiatives, which takes into consideration the Mizuho’s Corporate Identity, ISO 26000, and related standards, Mizuho updated its Definition of CSR Initiatives and its Basic Approach toward CSR Initiatives. Based on this fundamental approach, through initiatives of employees that reflect considerable sensitivity toward CSR in the conduct of their duties, Mizuho is implementing unified CSR initiatives with the objective of realizing Mizuho’s Vision established in its Corporate Identity. Mizuho’s Vision The most trusted financial services group with a global presence and a broad customer base, contributing to the prosperity of the world, Asia, and Japan To be our customer’s most trusted partner with innovative thinking and the The most trusted extensive financial experience and expertise accumulated from relationships with financial services group wide-ranging customers. To continuously provide the best leading-edge financial services to each of our The best financial customers, the related economies and societies we serve, by anticipating changes services provider on both the global and local stages. To maximize our extensive expertise and collective capabilities as experienced The most cohesive financial services professionals in order to meet the diversified and changing financial services group needs of our customers, economies and societies. Definition of CSR Initiatives CSR initiatives entail the practice of corporate activities that reflect an unwavering awareness toward the importance of Mizuho’s social responsibilities and public mission as a global financial group, take into consideration the expectations of stakeholders, and thoroughly fulfill its responsibilities toward society, which provides the basis for its existence. Basic Approach toward CSR Initiatives Recognizing that CSR initiatives help contribute to the sustainable development of society and provide the platform for creating and advancing corporate value, Mizuho has positioned CSR initiatives as a pillar of its corporate conduct. 7 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Initiatives to Strengthen CSR Management In fiscal 2013, Mizuho strengthened the implementation of its initiatives, taking account of its business strategy. Since 2005, Mizuho has been implementing policies related to mediumto long-term CSR initiative items. These have been environmental initiatives, corporate governance, and support for financial education, but, in recent years, it has become apparent that more so than before Mizuho is being required to contribute to the sustainable development of society through its business activities. To respond to this change in the operating environment, in fiscal 2013, Mizuho added to these three items two additional points of initiative focus (namely: finance to support the real economy and finance to meet new expectations) and is implementing these in its main business. In addition, through the new CSR Committee (Business Policy Committee) established in MHBK, MHTB, and MHSC, the core companies of the Group, each company is considering and strengthening CSR initiatives that take account of their respective business strategies. ■Highlights of Initiatives in Fiscal 2013 In our main business, we have seriously reconsidered that our social role as a financial institution is to provide a smooth flow of financing. Accordingly, we have strengthened our capabilities for meeting the funding needs of corporate customers appropriately for the growth stages of their development and worked to provide financial solutions that address a broad range of issues, including business and financial strategy.

In addition, we are accelerating the evolution of our business model and have taken steps to further strengthen our group governance, and strengthen our crisis management capabilities. Also in June 2014, we made the transition to a Company with Committees to further strengthen governance and realize faster and nimbler corporate management. Among these initiatives, progress was reported in the above areas in fiscal 2013. Preparation of a New Medium– and Long–Term CSR Initiative Policy During fiscal 2014, we reviewed our Mediumto Long-Term CSR Initiative items. This was because, in view of the growing sophistication and diversity of expectations regarding the activities of corporations as well as the clarification of “social responsibilities of organizations” under ISO 26000, we felt it was necessary to indicate a broader range of initiatives for the CSR activities of the Group as a whole, including placing additional emphasis on initiatives that take account of business strategy. Based on this awareness and taking full account of the points of initiative focus established in fiscal 2013 and various requirements as typified by ISO 26000, we prepared a new Medium– and Long–Term CSR Initiative Policy, comprising the following initiatives: “strengthening efforts to promote businesses that contribute to the sustainable development of society,” “reinforcing the Group's foundations that underpin activities in line with society's expectations,” “promoting social contributions activities that take into consideration the needs of local regions and society.” Medium– and Long–Term CSR Initiative Policy Core Business Foundation Social Contributions Strengthen eﬀorts to promote Reinforce the Group’s foundations Promote social contributions businesses that contribute to the that underpin activities in line with activities that take into sustainable development of society society’s expectations consideration the needs of local regions and society In addition to harnessing our broad Working to promote Based on the needs of local ﬁnancial service functions and communications with the broader regions and society, we will supporting the real economy from society and extending beyond engage in activities that take full the medium‒ and long‒term simple statutory and regulatory advantage of our management perspective, we will strengthen compliance, we will reinforce the resources and promote initiatives eﬀorts to promote business that Group’s foundations in a bid to that contribute to regional and contributes to the sustainable engage in activities across the social development. development of society in entire organization that take into response to the renewed consideration society’s expectations of stakeholders. expectations. 9 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Initiatives to Strengthen CSR Management Preparation of the Fiscal 2014 CSR Initiative Policy Linked to the Medium-Term Business Plan In fiscal 2014, we looked 10 years ahead, and taking account of the Medium-Term Business Plan, which was formulated based on a group strategy of aiming for the “new frontier” of finance and our awareness of the external environment, we prepared a policy for eight initiatives that we are implementing now.

To this end, in April 2013, we have newly formed four project teams, namely: “nextgeneration retail banking,” “next-generation industry development,” “next-generation Asia-related business,” and “invigoration of domestic financial assets,” thus, implementing consideration and initiatives for the realization of the “new frontier” of finance. 10 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Initiatives to Strengthen CSR Management Overview of Four Project Teams Four Project Teams Summaries Under the assumption that the retail banking business will undergo change along with developments in the external environment, the project team will pursue the creation of a business Next-generation retail model that goes beyond extrapolations from current business activities and trends. banking In April 2014, Mizuho created an Incubation Department with the objective of working with the project team to create new businesses flexibly in response to changes in the domestic and international environments. Because of changes in the industrial structure, this project team will endeavor to contribute to Next-generation Mizuho’s growth strategy by nurturing “new industries that will be necessary” and “industries that industry development have growth potential,” with a view especially to restoring and revitalizing the Japanese economy. To respond to the strong demand for funds that will be needed along with the high growth and Next-generation Asiaincreases in infrastructure investments in Asia, Mizuho will create and build new businesses related business in Asia by drawing on the know-how regarding financial markets and financial services it has accumulated in Japan. With an eye to rejuvenating the power of the ￥1,600 trillion in financial assets in Japan, this project team will consider such themes as how to encourage the transition, especially among Invigoration of domestic worker households, “from savings to long-term, tax-exempt investments,” the creation of financial assets frameworks for transferring the wealth of senior citizens to working-age people, and creating broader options for pension management. These themes will be considered from perspectives that will include “marketing channels,” “consulting services,” and “financial products.” Mizuho will work steadily to fulfill its mission as a financial institution and its role as a part of the social infrastructure. Also, from a mediumto long-term perspective, Mizuho will continue its initiatives to realize a “new frontier” of finance and thereby work to continue to create lasting value in any era that may come. Mizuho will also endeavor to realize “bringing fruitfulness” to its customers, to the economy, and to society as it continues to develop and increase its corporate value. 11 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Measures for the Enhancement of Group Governance In order to fulfill our social responsibilities as a member of the global financial community, we will exert efforts to further enhance our group governance and strengthen our crisis management capabilities, in addition to our efforts to further facilitate the progress of our business model. Furthermore, the Group will continuously make efforts to establish a strong corporate culture that supports strong group governance. Strengthening Governance through Transforming into a Company with Committees As part of efforts to further enhance our group governance, in June 2014, the Group transformed itself into a Company with Committees. Through such measures, the Group will thoroughly separate the supervisory functions from the execution of business in order to strengthen the supervisory functions by the Board of Directors over the execution of business and ensure the effectiveness of governance. At the same time, by delegating the Board of Directors’ decision-making authority concerning the execution of business to the Executive Officers to the maximum extent permitted by laws and regulations, the Group will realize the swift and flexible decision making that makes company management with a sense of speed possible. In addition, the Group will secure the transparency and fairness of its supervision process by actively introducing the perspective of outside persons in the Nominating Committee, Compensation Committee, and Audit Committee. Furthermore, the Group will actively adopt the global trends concerning governance through such measures as appointment of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors from among, in principle, Outside Directors. As for the strengthening of the Group’s crisis management capabilities, through the newly established designated organizations, the Group will continue to establish systems that will respond appropriately to crises by accurately detecting signs and indicators of crises in advance, in addition to its effort to strengthen the ability to respond to emergency situations or events of emergency. Measures to Form a Common Culture throughout the Group To form a common culture throughout the Group, each and every employee will take a flexible approach to changes in society and proactively step up to the challenges they face. Mizuho will also promote further strengthening the One MIZUHO Promotion Project Team in Japan and overseas by integrating the banking, trust banking, and securities functions from the perspective of driving the self-starting actions of each and every employee. Specifically, it will further strengthen continued actions related to each initiative that was started in the first year of the medium-term business plan, by having each division and branch create its own visions by holding discussions and supporting the initiatives towards realizing these visions, commencing discussion sessions with senior management at all head office and marketing offices, and off-site meetings for general managers of head office divisions and marketing offices at major group companies. 12 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Measures for the Enhancement of Group Governance Strengthening Governance through transforming into a Company with Committees Old Company with New Company with Board of Auditors Committees Holding Company (FG) Holding Company (FG) General Meeting of General Meeting of Shareholders Shareholders (Legally Required 3 Committees) Determine the contents of proposals Auditors Chairman Nominating regarding the appointment and Committee dismissal of directors Determine the compensation for each Chairman Compensation individual director and executive Board of Directors Board of Directors Committee Supervision, Audit officer, etc. Chairman Chairman Supervision, Audit / Management Prepare proposals regarding appointment Human Resources Review Meeting and dismissal of executive officers and basic policies regarding compensation Deputy Chairman for directors, etc. Chairman Audit Audit the execution of duties by Outside Outside Committee directors and executive officers, etc. Internal NonRisk Committee Give advice regarding risk governance executive Internal External Director Session President & CEO President & CEO Bank (BK) Trust & Banking Securities (SC) (Group CEO) (Group CEO) (TB) Executive Directors, Executive Officers*2 President & President & President & Executive Officer*1 CEO CEO CEO Management Personal Banking, Retail Banking, Corporate Banking Heads of Units Relationship Management Units (Large Corporations), Corporate Banking, Financial FG: Mizuho Financial Group Institutions & Public Sector Business, International Banking BK: Mizuho Bank TB: Mizuho Trust & Banking Products Units Investment Banking, Asset Management, SC: Mizuho Securities Heads of Units Markets Unit Transaction Banking, Markets Explanatory Note Outside (& Non-executive) Strategic Planning, Financial Control & Accounting, Heads of Groups Corporate Planning & Management Risk Management, Human Resources, IT & Systems, Internal & Non-executive Operations, Compliance Internal & executive *1: Executive Officer as defined in our internal regulations *2: Executive Officer as defined in the Companies Act and Executive Officer as defined in our internal regulations 13 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Special Feature on Activities to Nurture Next-Generation Industries As a financial institution based in Japan, Mizuho aims to contribute to the development of Japan’s economy and society and strengthen the competitiveness of Japanese industries. Active initiatives include “participation in creating the systems and frameworks through making policy recommendations and other activities,” “providing support for structuring business models, business matching, industry and business realignments, and other assistance,” and “supplying risk money and demonstrating risk-taking capabilities.” Mizuho has positioned agriculture, medical care, the senior market, the environment, and energy as growth industries. With the Next-Generation Industry Development Project Team as the focal point, Mizuho is aiming to support the nurturing of industries and develop opportunities for its own business activities. Mizuho is proceeding with these activities from a mediumto long-term perspective and on a groupwide basis. In fiscal 2013, Mizuho concentrated on a number of initiatives that were based on the strategies contained in its New Medium-Term Business Plan. These are “to perform consulting functions taking advantage of our industry and business knowledge and forwarded-looking perspective” and “to strengthen risk-taking functions for growth industries and corporations.” Thus, drawing on its strengths in knowledge of industries and sectors and in collaboration with both the public and private sectors, Mizuho focused especially on strengthening the competitiveness of agriculture, developing and upgrading industries to support the advanced aging society along with environmental improvements, broadening the use of renewable energy, and exporting Japan’s environment-related technology.

In all countries, the issue will be to secure the safety of energy supplies first, and then provide stable and economical supplies of energy that respond to environmental requirements. Mizuho, through its main business of providing financial products and services and based on the concept that, as a financial institution, its responsibility to society as a whole is to promote consideration for the environment, is taking initiatives in the environmental and energy fields. Both of these are growth sectors where Japanese companies can demonstrate their competitiveness based on their advanced technologies. The Group companies are undertaking environment-related activities in their respective business areas. Group companies are also aiming to contribute to nurturing environmentand energy-related industries and expand exports of infrastructure packages that embody Japan’s advanced technologies by drawing fully on the Group’s knowledge and its network, while collaborating with many other interests in the public and private sectors. Specific examples include Mizuho’s active implementation of many projects that have thus far been regarded as difficult to undertake, such as geothermal, offshore floating wind farm, and biomass power generation projects. Other initiatives include environmentally friendly city development projects and creating bilateral offset credit arrangements. Moreover, because of the strong recognition following the Great East Japan Earthquake of the importance of the renewable energy field within Japan’s energy policy, Mizuho Bank formed an organizationwide Renewable Energy Task Force in August 2011 to act as the central coordinating point for the crossdivisional sharing of information. Drawing on its extensive experience in financing many projects using renewable energy in Europe, which is a region playing a pioneering role in this field, Mizuho is providing broad support for companies newly entering the renewable energy power generation business and making use of the feed-in tariff system for electric power. In fiscal 2013, MHBK supported a domestic geothermal power generation project, which is regarded as the key to future expansion in geothermal power projects. In addition, MHTB became the first trust and banking company to develop trust arrangements for a megasolar power generation project. In addition, in the field of environmentally friendly city development projects, MHBK and MHIR participated in a smart community test project in the United Kingdom. 22 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Special Feature on Activities to Nurture Next-Generation Industries Overview of Initiatives in the Environmental and Energy Fields constructed since 2000, with an only exception Promoting Wider Utilization of of the construction of a small-scale geothermal Geothermal Power Generation in Japan power plant in 2006.

Having established the Tohoku Reconstruction Desk at its headquarters and its Industry and Regional Community Recovery Support Project Team, Mizuho is proactively engaging in information exchange and liaison activities with companies, financial institutions, and local government units in disaster-stricken areas as well as related central government units to maintain an accurate and timely grasp of needs and explore the most effective ways that Mizuho can contribute to reconstruction and recovery. Three years have passed now since the earthquake disaster. Steady progress is being made in restoring the infrastructure and housing in the affected areas, but is lagging behind the initial plans, and full restoration will take additional time. Labor markets in the region are firm, but this may be temporary and due in part to temporary public-sector demand. In addition, populations in the region have decreased, and the number of volunteers aiding in the recovery effort has diminished. Mizuho believes that the issues that must be confronted going forward include strengthening the industrial infrastructure with an eye to the future, revitalizing new cities and towns after restoration of the infrastructure and housing, and communicating information on current conditions in the region. Based on this perspective, Mizuho is placing emphasis on “job creation” by making the most of its broad range of capabilities—including those for industrial research, public-private partnership financing schemes, and other diverse financing methods, trust banking functions, and consulting—to provide support for industrial and regional revitalization. The Group is also engaging in various kinds of social contribution activities aimed at helping to promote the recovery of disaster-stricken areas. In addition, Mizuho is communicating information on its initiatives both internally and externally and is working to create a shared awareness of conditions in these areas.

Specifically, Mizuho aims to take a comprehensive approach to the development of its business activities that factors in economic, environmental, and social considerations. In order to advance these efforts given the specialized nature of the financial industry, Mizuho is an active participant in initiatives, such as “The United Nations Environmental Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) ”and “Principles for Financial Action towards a Sustainable Society.” When participating in loan operations for large-scale development and construction projects, MHBK has sought to ensure both environmental protection and economic development through financing operations that are based on The Equator Principles, which were adopted by the company in 2003 and provide a framework to ensure full consideration of the social and environmental impacts of such projects. In May 2014, MHBK became the first bank based in Asia to become chair bank of the Equator Principles Association. In investment activities as well, MHTB and Group asset management company DIAM, are signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), which ensure that institutional investors incorporate environmental, social, and corporate governance issues into their decision-making processes. Based on the purpose of PRI, MHTB and DIAM have incorporated considerations related to the environment, society, and corporate governance as indicators into some of their funds, and take these into consideration when exercising their voting rights. In considering environmental and social concerns in their activities, MHBK, MHTB, and MHSC have been promoting their “Heartful Project,” which aims to make branches easier to use for all customers, regardless of age, gender, or disability, through the adoption of barrier-free layouts and universal design principles. In addition, these Group financial institutions have created a system for assessing the impact of product and service development as well as advertising and promotion activities on human rights. To reduce the environmental burden of its business activities, MHFG as a whole is promoting electric power conservation and initiatives to bring about a recycling-based society. CONTENTS Initiatives for Equator Principles……………………………………………… 65 64 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Special Feature on Social and Environmental Considerations Given in Our Business Activities Initiatives for Equator Principles The Equator Principles provide a framework for confirming whether sufficient attention has been given to the environmental and social impact of large-scale development and construction projects that are financed by private financial institutions. Specifically, the financing institutions are required to follow the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC), a member of the World Bank group, environmental and social guidelines (the IFC Performance Standards) and the World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines. Under Equator Principles, Equator Principles affiliated financial institutions are required to assess the environmental and social impacts from large-scale projects, and incorporate compliance measures to meet the guidelines as a requirement of funding. As of the end of June 2014, 80 financial institutions had adopted the Equator Principles, which has become the de facto international standard in this field. MHBK continues to act on its initiative and activities. Therefore, in October 2003, MHBK engages with a diversity of stakeholders to became the first Asian bank to adopt these attain sustainable development. principles.

In February 2014, MHBK was encouraged to become a candidate for the next chair of the EPA by ING Bank, which had been chair since 2012. MHBK decided to accept this challenge because it would allow MHBK to even more actively fulfill its social responsibilities as a financial institution supporting both economic development and environmental and social sustainability. During the election, MHBK was highly recognized for its contributions to the Equator Principles Association and received favorable votes from all voting members and became the first Asian chair in May 2014. As the current chair, MHBK endeavors to increase familiarization of Equator Principle III to stakeholders, expand the number of banks adopting Equator Principles, to increase the transparency of Equator Principle implementation, by cooperating with many stakeholders. The point that MHBK focuses most when syndicating project finance is to create an environment, in which financial institutions find it easier to lend by reducing business risk to the lowest level possible. Therefore, it is important to provide support not only for profitability and security of projects but also for environmental and social risk management to create “sustainable projects.” The Equator Principles is a tool for proper management of environmental and social risk in such projects, and MHBK has provided assistance for preparation of action plans based on these principles that reduce 67 Mizuho Financial Group CSR Report 2014（Highlights） Special Feature on Social and Environmental Considerations Given in Our Business Activities Initiatives for Equator Principles Evolution of the Equator Principles and MHBK Activities Adopted by Adopted by Adopted by 10 banks 26 banks 80 banks Participation in the Evolution of the Equator Equator Principles Equator Principles II Strategic review Equator Principles III Cross Sector Biodiversity Launch Association formed Principles Initiative (CSBI) June 2003 July 2006 July 2010 October 2010 February 2013 June 2013 Participation on steering Equator Principles committee for organizational July 2010November 2013 adopted October 2003 operation and planning ・Outreach working group Support the Annual Meeting （Designated Asia’ s leading bank in August 2010） hosted by the Equator MHBK Activities March 2010・Biodiversity working group Principles Association November 2006 to July 2008 ・Climate change working group in Tokyo Participation Designated the secretariat bank ・Social risks working group in BBOP May 2014Designated Chair of the Equator Principles Association October 2008 June 2013 Industrial Bank’ s ﬁrst bank IDFC Limited’s ﬁrst bank in India in China to adopt principles to adopt the Equator Principles Third-party June 2007 Presented the Chairman’ s Sustainable Banking Award 2007 March 2009 Presented the Green Banking 2008 Contribution Award at the 2009 Evaluation International Forum on China Environmental Investment Voices of Interested Persons an intense time for the association.

In the area of elementary and secondary education, based on the results of a joint research project on financial education with Tokyo Gakugei University, Mizuho employees visit schools and teach finance-related classes. Mizuho also cooperates with a “workplace experience” program by providing opportunities at its branches nationwide for elementary and middle school students to experience actual work and thereby directly learn about the significance of work. In fiscal 2013, Mizuho employees taught classes as guest lecturers on 23 occasions, and students were invited to experience work environments at branches 112 times.

In addition, some opinions were voiced that Mizuho should substantially strengthen its initiatives to contribute to society through its main business. Among the areas where the most was expected of Mizuho were the following.
