The Bank’s functions were extended to support all commercial, economic and ﬁnancial relations of the Soviet Union with foreign countries. 1988 7 April 1924. The Russian Commercial Bank was transformed into the Bank for Foreign Trade of the USSR (Vneshtorgbank of the USSR). The Bank was nationalised and continued its active international operations as the country’s largest bank, second only to Gosbank. The Bank was intended to act as the major channel for all export 1924 and import operations and the only ﬁnancial agent for the government in global ﬁnancial markets. 18 August 1922. The Russian Commercial Bank (Roskombank) was established. The Bank was set up by Svenska Ekonomiebolaget, a foreign lending institution, to attract international capital to the Soviet Union and promote foreign trade in general. The Bank also issued guarantees to secure Soviet foreign trade contracts. 1922 14 Vnesheconombank intensiﬁed its activities as a development bank by increased funding of investment projects while streamlining the quality of its loan portfolio. The Bank ranks 7th in the rating published by Global Finance magazine, thereby reconﬁrming its status of the most reliable Russian ﬁnancial institution in the Central and Eastern Europe. 2013 2012 Vnesheconombank was actively building Vnesheconombank Group combining major commercial banks of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus 2011 and specialised organisations that are engaged in, or facilitate, investment operations. 2010 Vnesheconombank launched the government programme for supporting 2009 smalland medium-sized enterprises, and acted as the major lender to Olympic construction projects in Sochi. Vnesheconombank launched crisis management measures to bolster 2008 the Russian ﬁnancial system. As a result of reorganisation, Vnesheconombank of the USSR was transformed into State Corporation “Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs (Vnesheconombank)”. 2007 Vnesheconombank became the national development bank playing a key role in conducting the government investment policy. 15 VNESHECONOMBANK / Vnesheconombank Group Sustainability Report 2013 Vnesh­econom­bank’s Strategy 01 16 VEB is the national bank for development assisting implementation of the state socio-economic policies, enhancing competitiveness of the national economy and its modernization on an innovative basis. The Bank sees its mission in driving Russia’s development forward through financing investment projects of national importance. The implementation of such projects encourages diversification and efficiency of the Russian economy. Economy modernization, in its turn, gives a strong impetus to serious social transformations in the country. 17 VNESHECONOMBANK / Vnesheconombank Group Sustainability Report 2013 1.1.
