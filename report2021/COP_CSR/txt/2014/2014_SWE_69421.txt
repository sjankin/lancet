Developing governance Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2013 13 Lantmännen creates long-term economic value Lantmännen’s mission is to contribute to the profitability of its owners’ farms and maximize the return on their capital in the association. As business partners and owners of Lantmännen, they share the Group’s profit through dividends. Lantmännen has distributed more than SEK 3.2 billion to its members since 2001. Lantmännen is committed to generating regular and stable dividends for its owners over time. A total dividend of MSEK 298 is proposed for 2013. Owner value Where are earnings created? Lantmännen consists of farming operations and extensive commercial and industrial activities including mills, bakeries and international machinery operations. Most of the earnings are generated in the industrial activities. Here you can clearly see the advantages for Lantmännen members in integration along the value chain and having profitable industrial activities. As owners, they receive a higher margin higher up the value chain, rather than just being sub-suppliers. The value created is then How are earnings distributed? shared with the members.
