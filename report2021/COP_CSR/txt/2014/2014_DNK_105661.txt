Sustainable sourcing of raw materials is the backbone of AAK‚Äôs business and a key element of the AAKtion program. The combination of the right raw materials and value-adding functionality is key to the wide range of solutions offered. Just as it is vital for AAK to obtain the right raw materials, AAK places equal emphasis on sustainable growing and procurement. For this reason AAK has implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct that applies to AAK‚Äôs direct raw material suppliers worldwide.
