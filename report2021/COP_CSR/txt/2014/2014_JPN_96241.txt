Nowadays, most of what we use in our daily lives—from food and clothes to appliances, automobiles and even energy—is produced somewhere else in the world and only reaches us after a long journey through the global supply chain. Value is created by delivering what people need where they need it, enriching the lives of both the senders and the receivers. This was first made possible by marine shipping, which is an inexpensive means of large-volume shipping. Marine shipping has made the world smaller and the economy bigger.

Recently solid growth through innovation. Annual Report 2014 5 In April 2014, MOL celebrated its 130th anniversary. Marine shipping is a growth industry and yet, over the 150-year history of modern marine shipping, more than a few shipping companies have collapsed. Why has MOL continued to grow amid what can admittedly be a hostile environment? MOL has advanced by adapting its businesses to the changing business environment ever since Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK Lines), its corporate predecessor, was established in 1884. During the intervening years, MOL has been invigorated with the addition of distinct corporate cultures through two major mergers, creating the robust spirit of innovation and resilience unique to hybrids. And now, once again, the flow of cargo is on the verge of a major sea change. With its eye on 2020, MOL is already adjusting its course to prepare for major changes six years down the line.

The shale revolution occurring in the United States is transforming the global geopolitics of energy and bringing about a major shift in seaborne trade. In the flows of product trade, the trend toward diversification is ongoing. In some cases, producing regions are moving closer to consuming regions. MOL not only must remain alert to demand movements, but also sensitive to prevailing conditions in global shipyards, which impact the supply-demand balance of vessels. This shifting business environment will bring opportunities to those who can anticipate the changes and meet the new challenges and risks to those who underestimate them. The shale revolution will affect many aspects of seadiligently monitor the situation. borne trade.

Lines Message from the President Achieving Profit Recovery and Returning to a Growth Trajectory Question 1: How would you evaluate the results of the fiscal 2013 management-plan “RISE2013 ”? It was a good year, exceptional in many respects. RISE2013 was itself an exception, with a timeframe of just one year. We typically launch midterm management plans with a horizon of three years, but and net gearing ratio improved to 135% (we had targeted 154%). 1 Looking closer, bulkships were on a clear upswing, but containerships went the other way, ending the year in a loss.

This trend forms of cargo transportation. While 42 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines service out of Mexico, we quickly uncovered various unmet transport needs that we had not been able to grasp before beginning the service. In addition, even when a single cross-trade shipment does not break even, it can still be a catalyst to create sustainable services when linked with other cargo trends. We are able to achieve first-mover advantage and create services that other competitors cannot match by identifying new emerging needs as well as the future growth potential of shipping routes, swiftly making decisions, and rapidly building our shipping track record. The development of inland infrastructure in emerging markets helps increase our loading volumes there. MOL will adhere to its existing policies for development and implement them as necessary. In India, we relatively recently got into the inland transport business as well as the automobile terminal business at Ennore Port. Also, we are engaged in operating terminals in Australia and Turkey. However, we believe it is imperative that each endeavor maximizes synergies with our main business of maritime transport or strengthens relationships with customers expanding into those areas. “STEER FOR 2020” will continue MOL’s aim for improving both profitability and customer satisfaction. We will continue to meet the challenge of increasingly complex and diverse seaborne trade. We will dare not to plant the conventional pivot foot, but rather create a resilient system that adapts adroitly to our customers’ needs by changing our shipping routes flexibly as we pursue ever more efficient vessel allocation and operation.

Annual Report 2014 81 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. March 31, 2014 and 2013 1. BASIS OF PRESENTING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (together “Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. The accounts of overseas subsidiaries are made revisions according to ASBJ PITF No.18. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restructured and translated into English (with some expanded descriptions) from the consolidated financial statements of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (the “Company”) prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. Some supplementary information included in the statutory Japanese language consolidated financial statements, but not required for fair presentation, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The translations of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan, using the prevailing exchange rate at March 31, 2014, which was ¥102.92 to U.S. $1.00. The convenience translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate of exchange. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (1) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION All companies are required to consolidate all significant investees which are controlled through substantial ownership of majority voting rights or existence of certain conditions. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 357 subsidiaries for the year ended March 31, 2014 (349 subsidiaries for the year ended March 31, 2013). All significant inter-company balances, transactions and all material unrealized profit within the consolidated group have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies (20% to 50% owned and certain others 15% to 20% owned) are accounted for by the equity method. Companies accounted for using the equity method include 73 affiliated companies for the year ended March 31, 2014, and 65 affiliated companies for the year ended March 31, 2013. Investments in other subsidiaries (114 for the year ended March 31, 2014 and 107 for the year ended March 31, 2013) and affiliated companies (69 and 68 for the respective years) were stated at cost since total revenues, total assets, the Company’s equity in net income and retained earnings and others in such companies were not material. In the elimination of investments in subsidiaries, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries, including the portion attributable to minority shareholders, are recorded based on the fair value at the time the Company acquired control of the respective subsidiaries. The difference between acquisition cost and net assets acquired is treated as goodwill and negative goodwill and is amortized principally over 5 years on a straight-line basis. Net amortized amount is included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” or “Other income” of the consolidated statements of operations. Meanwhile, the negative goodwill incurred after April 1, 2010 is recognized as “Other income” at the time of occurrence in accordance with the revised Japanese GAAP. (2) TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY Revenues earned and expenses incurred in currencies other than Japanese yen of the Company and its subsidiaries keeping their books in Japanese yen are translated into Japanese yen either at a monthly exchange rate or at the rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than Japanese yen are translated into yen at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Subsidiaries keeping their books in a currency other than Japanese yen translate the revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities in foreign currencies into the currency used for financial reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries. All the items in financial statements of subsidiaries, which are stated in currencies other than Japanese yen, were translated into Japanese yen at the year-end exchange rate, except for owners’ equity which is translated at historical rates. Translation differences arising from the application of more than one exchange rate are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments in the net assets section of the consolidated balance sheets. 82 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (3) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS In preparing the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash on hand, readily-available deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with maturities not exceeding three months at the time of purchase are considered to be cash and cash equivalents. (4) FREIGHT REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES 1. Containerships Freight revenues and the related voyage expenses are recognized by the multiple transportation progress method. 2. Vessels other than containerships Freight revenues and the related voyage expenses are recognized mainly by the completed-voyage method. (5) SECURITIES Securities are classified into (a) securities held for trading purposes (hereafter, “trading securities”), (b) debt securities intended to be held to maturity (hereafter, “held-to-maturity debt securities”), (c) equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies, or (d) for all other securities that are not classified in any of the above categories (hereafter, “available-for-sale securities”). Trading securities are stated at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses from market value fluctuations are recognized as gains or losses in the period of the change. Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost, net of the amount considered not collectible. Equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies which are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method are stated at moving-average cost. Available-for-sale securities with fair market values are stated at fair market values, and the corresponding unrealized holding gains or losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as separate component of net assets. Other securities with no available fair market value are stated at moving-average cost. If the market value of held-to-maturity debt securities, equity securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies not on the equity method, and available-for-sale securities, declines significantly, such securities are stated at fair market value and the difference between fair market value and the carrying amount is recognized as loss in the period of the decline. If the fair market value of held-to-maturity debt securities, equity securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies not on the equity method, and available-for-sale securities is not readily available, such securities should be written down to net assets value with a corresponding charge in the statements of operations in the event net assets value declines significantly. In these cases, such fair market value or the net assets value will be the carrying amount of the securities at the beginning of the next year. (6) INVENTORIES Inventories are stated principally at cost determined by the moving-average method (with regard to the book value of inventories on the balance sheet, by writing the inventories down based on their decrease in profitability of assets). (7) DEPRECIATION OF VESSELS, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Depreciation of vessels and buildings is computed mainly by the straight-line method. Depreciation of other property and equipment is computed mainly by the declining-balance method. Depreciation of finance lease that transfer ownership to lessees is computed mainly by the identical to depreciation method applied to self-owned non-current assets. Depreciation of finance lease that do not transfer ownership to lessees is computed mainly by straight-line method on the assumption that the lease term is the useful life and an estimated residual is zero. With regard to finance lease that do not transfer ownership for which the starting date for the lease transaction is prior to March 31, 2008, they are continuously accounted for by a method corresponding to that used for ordinary operating lease contracts. (8) AMORTIZATION OF BOND ISSUE EXPENSE AND STOCK ISSUE EXPENSE Bond issue expense and stock issue expense are charged to income as incurred. (9) INTEREST CAPITALIZATION In cases where a vessel’s construction period is long and the amount of interest accruing during this period is significant, such interest expenses are capitalized as a part of the acquisition cost which amounted to ¥2,802 million ($27,225 thousand) for the year ended March 31, 2014 and ¥1,228 million for the year ended March 31, 2013. (10) ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Allowance for doubtful accounts is provided in an amount sufficient to cover probable losses on collection. It consists of the estimated uncollectible amount with respect to certain identified doubtful receivables and an amount calculated using the actual percentage of the Company’s collection losses. (11) DIRECTORS’ AND CORPORATE AUDITORS’ RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company and its domestic subsidiaries recognize liabilities for retirement benefits for directors and corporate auditors at an amount required in accordance with the internal regulations. Effective from the shareholders’ meeting of the Company, held on June 23, 2005, the Company abolished the retirement benefits plan for directors and corporate auditors. Accordingly, the Company recognizes liabilities for retirement benefit for directors and corporate auditors till the completion of the shareholders’ meeting on June 23, 2005, which will be paid upon their retirement. Annual Report 2014 83 (12) EMPLOYEES’ SEVERANCE AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company has the defined benefit pension plans for employees engaged in shore and sea services. Employees engaged in sea service who retire prior to a certain age are also entitled to a lump-sum payment. Some subsidiaries have the defined benefit pension plans which cover all or a part of the retirement benefits and some other subsidiaries have established reserves for a lump-sum payment for retirement benefits. The Company has a retirement benefit trust scheme. Under the accounting standards for employees’ severance and retirement benefits, liabilities and expenses for employees’ severance and retirement benefits are determined based on the amounts actuarially calculated using certain assumptions. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Group”) recognized net defined benefit assets and net defined benefit liabilities for employees’ severance and retirement benefits at March 31, 2014 and 2013 based on the estimated amounts of projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets at those dates. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the statements of operations using the straight-line method over the average of the estimated remaining service lives of mainly 10 years commencing with the following period. Past service costs are chiefly accounted for as expenses in lump-sum at the time of occurrence. (13) INCOME TAXES The Group recognizes tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statements of operations. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences. (14) AMOUNTS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK Net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed based upon the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Fully diluted net income per share of common stock assumes exercise of the outstanding stock options at the beginning of the year or at the date of issuance. For the year ended March 31, 2013, fully diluted net income per share is not disclosed because of the Company’s net loss position. Cash dividends per share have been presented on an accrual basis and include dividends to be approved after the balance sheet date, but applicable to the year then ended. (15) DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING Companies are required to state derivative financial instruments at fair value and to recognize changes in the fair value as gains or losses unless derivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes. If derivative financial instruments are used as hedging instruments and meet certain hedging criteria, the Group defers recognition of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments until the related losses or gains on the hedged items are recognized. If interest rate swap contracts are used as hedging instruments and meet certain hedging criteria, the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap contract is added to or deducted from the interest on the assets or liabilities for which the swap contract was executed (“special treatment”). If foreign exchange forward contracts are used as hedging instruments and meet certain hedging criteria, hedged foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of these contracts (“allocation method”). The following summarizes hedging derivative financial instruments used by the Group and items hedged: Hedging instruments: Hedged items: Loans payable in foreign currencies Foreign currency future transactions Forward foreign exchange contracts Foreign currency future transactions Currency option contracts Foreign currency future transactions Currency swap contracts Foreign currency loans payable Interest rate swap contracts Interest on loans and bonds payable Crude oil swap contracts Fuel oil Commodities futures Fuel oil Freight futures Freight The derivative transactions are executed and managed by the Company in accordance with the established policies in order to hedge the Group’s exposure to interest rate increases, fuel oil increases, freight decreases, and foreign currency exchange rate risk. 84 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines The Company evaluates hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative changes in cash flows from or the changes in fair value of hedged items and the cumulative changes in cash flows from or the changes in fair value of hedging instruments. (16) RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation. (17) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Application of accounting standards for retirement benefits) The Group has applied the Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits (ASBJ Statement No. 26, May 17, 2012) and the Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits (ASBJ Guidance No. 25, May 17, 2012), except for the provisions of the main clauses of Paragraph 35 of the Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits and Paragraph 67 of the Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits, effective from the year ended March 31, 2014. Accordingly, the Group has changed its accounting policy to one that recognizes the difference between retirement benefit obligations and plan assets as net defined benefit liabilities or net defined benefit assets and recorded unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs under net defined benefit liabilities or net defined benefit assets. Application of the Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits and Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits is in line with the transitional measures provided in Paragraph 37 of the Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits. In accordance with such measures, the effect of the change has been added to or deducted from remeasurements of defined benefit plans under accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of March 31, 2014. As a result of the change, as of March 31, 2014, net defined benefit liabilities of 12,936 million yen ($125,690 thousand) and net defined benefit assets of 21,200 million yen ($205,985 thousand) were recognized. Also, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was increased by 1,186 million yen ($11,524 thousand). (18) CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES WITH AMENDMENT OF RESPECTIVE LAW OR REGULATION THAT ARE NOT DISTINGUISHABLE FROM CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Change in depreciation method) From the year ended March 31, 2013, in accordance with the amendment in corporate tax law, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries have changed its depreciation method for property and equipment. Assets acquired on or after April 1, 2012 are depreciated using the method prescribed in amended corporate tax law. The effect on the consolidated financial statements of the change is not material. (19) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET APPLIED Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits (ASBJ Statement No.26, May 17, 2012) and Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits (ASBJ Guidance No.25, May 17, 2012) 1. Summary Methods for recognizing unrealized actuarial gains and losses and past service costs, methods for calculating retirement benefit obligations and current service costs and expansion of disclosures have been amended. 2. Effective dates Amendments relating to assessment of retirement benefit obligations and current service costs are effective from the year ending on or after March 31, 2015. As transitional treatments are provided in these new standards, they were not applied retrospectively to consolidated financial statements in prior years. 3. Effect of application of the standard The Group is currently under assessment of the effects of these new standards on the consolidated financial statements. (20) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Change of estimated useful life) As a part of the Business Structural Reforms executed in the previous year, the Group reviewed the policy on use of vessels based on actual operating experience. Then, the Group found that vessels can be used longer than their conventional estimated useful lives. Therefore, starting from the year ended March 31, 2014, the period of useful lives of dry bulkers and car carriers were changed from 15 years to 20 years, and tankers from 13-18 years to 20-25 years, respectively. As a result, operating income and income before income taxes and minority interests for the year was increased by ¥10,684 million ($103,809 thousand), respectively. Annual Report 2014 85 3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (1) Qualitative information on financial instruments I. Policies for using financial instruments We raise capital investment funds to acquire vessels and other fixed assets primarily through bank loans and corporate bonds. In addition, we secure short-term operating funds through commercial papers and bank loans. Furthermore, we have established commitment line with Japanese banks in preparation for supplementing liquidity in emergency situations. Derivatives are utilized to hedge risks as discussed below and are executed within the scope of real requirements. Our policy is not to use derivatives for speculative purposes. II. Details of financial instruments / Risk and its management Trade receivables are exposed to the credit risks of customers. We strive to mitigate such risks in accordance with internal regulations. Besides, trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to the foreign currency exchange rate risk. We avoid the risk mainly by, in principle, utilizing forward exchange contracts which cover the net position (The difference between trade receivables and trade payables dominated in foreign currencies). Investment securities are mainly stocks of companies with which we have business relationships. These investment securities are exposed to the price fluctuation risk. We identify the market value of listed stocks on a quarterly basis. Trade payables are due within a year. Short-term loans and commercial papers are primarily used for raising short-term operating funds, while long-term loans and bonds are mainly for capital investments. Although several items with variable interest rates are exposed to the interest rate risk, a certain portion of such variable interest rates is fixed with the use of interest rate swaps. Long-term loans and bonds denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to the foreign currency exchange rate risk, a part of which is avoided by using currency swaps. Our major derivative transactions and hedged risks are as follows. * Forward foreign exchange contracts / Currency swap contracts : To cover exchange volatility of foreign-currency-denominated trade receivables, trade payables, long-term loans, and corporate bonds. * Interest rate swap contracts : To avoid interest rate risk arising out of interest payment of long-term loans and corporate bonds. * Crude oil swap contracts / Commodities futures : To hedge fluctuation of fuel oil price. With regard to the detail of hedge accounting (hedging instruments, hedged items, the way of evaluating hedge effectiveness), see Note 2 (15) to the consolidated financial statements. Derivative transactions are executed and managed in accordance with our internal regulations and dealt only with highly rated financial institutions to mitigate credit risks. On the other hand, as trade payables, loan payables, bonds, and commercial papers are exposed to the risk of financing for repayment, we manage the risk by planning cash management program monthly, having established commitment line with several financial institutions, and adjusting funding period (balancing short-term/long-term combination), in consideration of market circumstances. III. Supplemental information on fair value Fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organized financial markets is determined by market value. For those where there are no active markets, it is determined by reasonable estimation. Reasonably estimated value might vary depending on condition of calculation as several variation factors are included in the calculation. On the other hand, derivative transactions mentioned in following (2) do not indicate the market risk of such derivatives. 86 Mitsui O.S.K.

Negative amount stated with ( ) means that the net amount is liability. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the assets and liabilities measured at the fair value. Cash and cash equivalents, Time deposits with a maturity of more than three months, Trade receivables and Short-term loans receivable Since these assets are settled in a short term and their fair value is almost equal to the book value, the fair value is evaluated at the book value. Marketable securities and Investment securities The fair value of stocks is evaluated at market prices at stock exchange as of the end of the year and the fair value of bonds is evaluated at market prices at stock exchange or provided by financial institutions as of the end of the years. Long-term loans receivable The fair value of long-term loans receivable with variable interests rate is evaluated at the book value because the interest rate reflects the market rate in a short term and their fair value is almost equal to the book value, unless the creditworthiness of the borrower has changed significantly since the loan origination. The fair value of long-term loans receivable with fixed interest rates, for each category of loans based on types of loans, and maturity length, is evaluated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest using the rate which would apply if similar loans were newly made. Trade payables, Short-term loans and Commercial paper Since these liabilities are settled in a short term and their fair value is almost equal to the book value, the fair value is evaluated at the book value. Bonds The fair value of corporate bonds with market price is evaluated based on their market price. The fair value of variable interest rates corporate bonds without market price is evaluated at the book value because the interest rate reflects the market rate in a short term and there has been no significant change in the creditworthiness of us before and after the issue. 88 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Long-term bank loans The fair value of long-term bank loans with variable interest rates is evaluated at the book value because the interest rate reflects the market rate in a short term and there has been no significant change in the creditworthiness of us before and after such bank loans were made. The fair value of long-term bank loans with fixed interest rates, for each category of bank loans based on types of bank loans, and maturity length, is evaluated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest using the rate which would apply if similar bank loans were newly made. The fair value of long-term bank loans qualifying for allocation method of interest and currency swap is evaluated at the book value because such bank loans were deemed as the variable interest rates bank loans and the interest rate reflects the market rate in a short term.

NET ASSETS Net assets comprises four sections, which are the owners’ equity, accumulated other comprehensive income, share subscription rights and minority interests. Under the Japanese Companies Act (“the Act”) and regulations, the entire amount paid for new shares is required to be designated as common stock. However, a company may, by a resolution of the board of directors, designate an amount not exceeding one-half of the price of the new shares as additional paid-in-capital, which is included in capital surplus. Under the Act, in cases where a dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in-capital and legal earnings reserve must be set aside as additional paid-in-capital or legal earnings reserve. Legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the Act, appropriations (legal earnings reserve and additional paid-in-capital could be used to eliminate or reduce a deficit or could be capitalized ) generally require a resolution of the shareholders’ meeting.

Lines 22. OTHERS The Group is subject to investigations by overseas competition law authorities including those of the U.S. and Europe for violation of competition laws of those countries regarding price control negotiations for ocean transport services of completely built-up vehicles. In addition, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. and other countries against the Group for damage claims and for a cease and desist order for the questioned conduct. Meanwhile, the effect of these investigations and lawsuit on the financial results of Group is uncertain as its financial impact is not estimable at this stage. In Japan, the Company had been under investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (the “JFTC”) since September 2012 for violation of the Japanese Antimonopoly Act regarding certain car carrier shipping trades. However, the Company was exempted from all of the Cease and Desist Orders and Surcharge Payment Orders issued by the JFTC in March 2014 because the JFTC accepted an application made by the Company under the JFTC’s leniency program. Meanwhile, Nissan Motor Car Carrier Co., Ltd., which is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, also made an application under the JFTC’s leniency program and secured a reduction of its surcharge, but was not exempted from the Cease and Desist Order and Surcharge Payment Order.
