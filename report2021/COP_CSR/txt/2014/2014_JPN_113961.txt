Concept of the Reporting The Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation (MCHC) Group is aiming to realize KAITEKI through its corporate activities. KAITEKI is an original concept of the MCHC Group that signifies “a sustainable condition which is comfortable for people, society and the Earth, transcending time and generations.” Aiming for the realization of KAITEKI, since April 2011, the MCHC Group has adopted a new management that we call “KAITEKI Management.” KAITEKI Management consists of three types of management. Two of these are, “management with a focus on capital efficiency” utilizing conventional financial indexes and “management that strives to create innovations for society.” The third management approach, “management that aims to improve sustainability” using our unique ESG (Environment, Society, and Corporate Governance) indexes offers a new perspective. We seek to increase the corporate value that these types of management generate. Moreover, from fiscal 2013, we have been publishing this report as the KAITEKI Report which summarizes the progress, achievements, and outlook of KAITEKI Management in one volume. In preparation of the KAITEKI Report 2014, we referred to the International <IR> Framework published by the International Integrated Reporting Council in December 2013 as much as possible at the current stage, based on our view is is a u that this mework forr reporting th sefu ul fframework ram useful the aforrementio he aforementioned o KAITEKI gemement me Management. n.

Following fiscal 2013, we published the KAITEKI Report 2014, which summarizes the progress of our KAITEKI Management, including the results and the future outlook of the MCHC Group and other issues in one volume. We attempted to make the content even easier for all of our stakeholders to understand, for example, by referencing the International Integrated Reporting Framework. The Group is making every effort to achieve the goals of Transformation Special Feature: New horizons for healthcare solutions Transformation KAITEKI Management, and we hope the report helps you reach a deeper understanding. Fiscal 2013 Results Based on APTSIS 15, the Group’s medium-term management plan covering Business Performance fiscal 2011–2015, we took measures such as reorganizing and withdrawing from unprofitable businesses, strengthening and enhancing the foundation of businesses such as performance polymers, reducing costs, and reexamining capital expenditures, resulting in higher sales, operating income, and net income compared to the previous fiscal year. Innovation In the year under review, the Japanese economy recovered moderately because of an improved export environment due to monetary and fiscal policies that effectively addressed the overvalued yen, as well as signs of improvement in domestic demand. Looking at the business environment surrounding the MCHC Group, weakness was apparent in the move toward economic recovery in regions such as the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Europe for the Performance Products and Industrial Materials domains. Sustainability However, overseas demand generally showed a slight trend toward recovery, and the domestic economy also recovered modestly. As a result of these and other factors, the business environment continued to improve. On the other hand, the Health Care domain faced severe conditions with the expansion of generic drug use as well as other factors in Japan, despite favorable sales figures of license-out products in overseas markets. In the year under review, based on APTSIS 15, the MCHC Group continued with Governance its business structural reform and shift (“transformation”). This included accelerating reorganization or withdrawal from unprofitable businesses, and enhancing and expanding the foundation of the performance polymers business. Moreover, we strengthened the Group’s comprehensive capabilities by creating synergies among the operating companies, and took a variety of measures including thorough cost-cutting, revising capital expenditures, and scaling back assets with a view to improve group-wide profitability. Financial Section As a result of the above, our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2013 showed ¥3,498.8 billion in net sales, an increase of ¥410.2 billion (13.2%) from the previous fiscal year, partly because some of our overseas subsidiaries recorded net sales for 15 months due to a change in accounting periods. Looking at profits, our operating income was ¥110.4 billion, an increase of ¥20.2 billion (22.4%) from the previous fiscal year, and ordinary income was ¥103.0 billion, an increase of Corporate Information ¥16.0 billion (18.4%), thanks to strong demand for display-related products, especially touch panels, our efforts to cut costs, and the yen’s depreciation despite continued soft supplyand-demand balances in some petrochemical-related products. In addition, our net income was ¥32.2 billion, an increase of ¥13.6 billion (73.4%), due to extraordinary gains associated with the Remicade arbitration award in the pharmaceutical business. Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation KAITEKI Report 2014 13 T ransformation Future Outlook and Issues the MCHC Group Must Address We intend to devote maximum efforts to achieving our goals by reliably and rapidly executing measures that include our business structural reform and shift (“transformation”), strengthening the Group’s comprehensive capabilities by further creating synergies among our operating companies, and improving our financial position. Turning to the Japanese economy, the impact of the decline in personal consumption following the increase in the consumption tax rate has been generally within assumptions, and we expect the economy to continue on the current gradual recovery path, backed by the effects of monetary and financial policies. The global economy, centered on the developed countries in Europe and the U.S., is expected to remain in a gradual recovery but there are concerns about a downturn in overseas economies triggered by the reduction of monetary easing in the U.S., the slowdown in economic growth in PRC and emerging markets, and geopolitical risks. In this business environment, the MCHC Group will take steps toward its business structural reform and shift (transformation) based on APTSIS 15 by strengthening the Group's comprehensive capabilities with enhanced synergies among our operating companies, and the improvement of our financial position. In the Performance Products domain, we will accelerate the expansion and globalization Transformation of MCHC Group Business Portfolio Next-generation Growth Businesses Growth Businesses Businesses under Businesses that make Leaping development that we concentrated injections of Ahead prioritize for strengthening management resources with the development of Growth the aim of further expanding Business candidates profits Businesses Cash-generating to be Restructured Businesses Withdrawal Businesses that are aiming Businesses that are responsible to revise the structure of for ensuring a stable profit their business and base using limited resource organization to develop investments more efficient businesses We have pushed ahead with our portfolio transformation using a business management technique called the fourquadrant model that allows us to classify a broad range of businesses based on their life cycles and reallocate resources optimally. We are aiming to continuously create new value and make the Group grow sustainably by reallocating management resources obtained from the Cash-generating Businesses to the Growth Businesses and the Nextgeneration Growth Businesses without depending on a specific business life cycle. 14 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation KAITEKI Report 2014 of sectors that we have positioned as Stable Businesses, such as specialty chemicals, and we will Message from the President work to swiftly expand earnings from carbon fiber and composite materials, water treatment Value systems and services, agribusiness solutions, and other Growth Driver Businesses. In the Health Care domain, we will strengthen our drug discovery capabilities in the pharmaceutical business and move ahead with the building of the infrastructure to expand our overseas businesses. At the same time, under the leadership of the Life Science Institute, Inc., which we launched in April 2014, we will strengthen and expand the foundation of the Transformation Special Feature: New horizons for healthcare solutions healthcare solutions business. → Related information p.20-23 Transformation In the Industrial Materials domain, we are reorganizing the ethylene center and further reforming our business structures for terephthalic acid, a raw material for synthetic fibers. In methyl methacrylate (MMA) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), which are Stable Businesses, we will establish an optimal global supply structure, including measures to respond to the shale revolution, to maintain and further strengthen our advantage in the Business Performance market. As part of this, in February 2014 we decided to build new MMA and PMMA plants jointly with Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (slated to start operation in the middle of 2017), and in the U.S. we began studies of a joint venture related to MMA with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and The Dow Chemical Company in June 2014 (slated to start operation at the end of 2018). Taking into account the above circumstances, we forecast the consolidated financial results for fiscal 2014 with net sales of ¥3,530.0 billion, an increase of ¥31.1 billion (0.8%) from Innovation the year under review, operating income of ¥136.0 billion, an increase of ¥25.5 billion (23.1%), Four-quadrant Model Growth Model (Management based on profit structures) Sustainability in Business Portfolio Management (Management based on product Stable Growth Driver Volatile life cycles and business growth Businesses Businesses Businesses Businesses that are Businesses where the Businesses in which potential and profit potential) relatively unaﬀected by Group is targeting signiﬁcant volatility changes in the market strategic sales growth due to external factors and are expected to is unavoidable Volatility (high) provide stable income in Governance the medium-to-long term Growth potential (+) Nextgeneration Next-generation Next-generation Next-generation Growth Growth Growth Growth Businesses Growth Growth Growth Businesses Businesses Businesses Growth Businesses Businesses Businesses Businesses Businesses to be Restructured Cash-generating Businesses Profitability (+) Financial Section Businesses Cash-generating Businesses Cash-generating Businesses Cash-generating to be Restructured Businesses to be Restructured Businesses to be Restructured Businesses ● Polyester film ● Organic photovoltaic modules and ● Performance molding products ● PVOH/EVOH materials ● Terephthalic acid ● Engineering plastic products ● Organic photo-semiconductors ● Phenol and polycarbonate chain ● Pharmaceuticals ● Advanced performance products ● Polyolefins ● MMA/PMMA (AQSOA and others) ● Basic petrochemicals ● High-performance graphite ● Agribusiness solutions ● Carbon black and rubber Corporate Information ● Performance polymers ● Sustainable resources ● Electronic and industrial films ● Specialty chemicals ● Healthcare Solutions ● Fibers ● High-performance films ● Carbon fiber and composite materials and others ● Food ingredients ● White LED lighting and materials ● Diagnostics and support for ● Lithium-ion battery materials new pharmaceutical development ● Water treatment systems and services ● Coke and others and others Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation KAITEKI Report 2014 15 T ransformation and net income of ¥38.0 billion, an increase of ¥5.7 billion (17.8%). The conditions continue to be tough for achieving operating income of ¥280.0 billion, a target of the final fiscal year (fiscal 2015) for Step 2 of APTSIS 15, but we will maximize our efforts to achieve these targets. We will move decisively and rapidly to address the aforementioned issues, while continuing to shift our business structures. On the other hand, as a part of our Leaping Ahead strategy, in October 2013 we further strengthened our capital and business alliance with Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation by increasing our equity participation. In June 2014, we decided to implement a takeover bid to transform the company into an MCHC consolidated subsidiary during 2014. Taiyo Nippon Sanso is the leading industrial gas manufacturer in Japan. We will increase the corporate value of both companies and proceed with our business structural transformation with the following measures. By incorporating the industrial gas business into the MCHC Group portfolio and concentrating the global management resources of the two companies, we will cooperatively utilize manufacturing and sales bases and supply chains, and operate in new locations overseas as a response to the shale revolution. We will also pursue synergies and new product development in the electronics and healthcare fields. We have implemented a number of mergers and acquisitions. These efforts have not only expanded the Group’s business scale and promoted synergies, but also diversified human resources by inviting new personnel in our Group to raise awareness and revitalize the organization. We think this is an essential part of our transformation. 16 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation KAITEKI Report 2014 KAITEKI Management Message from the President Value As “THE KAITEKI COMPANY,” the Company Uses Materiality Assessment to Identify Issues Essential to the Development of Our KAITEKI Management. The MCHC Group has established “Sustainability [Green],” “Health,” and “Comfort” as the decision criteria for our corporate activities. We added Management of Sustainability Transformation Special Feature: New horizons for healthcare solutions (MOS), with the aim of improving sustainability, to the existing Management of Economics Transformation (MOE), which focuses on capital efficiency by utilizing conventional financial indexes, and Management of Technology (MOT), which strives to create innovations for society. We also applied the element of time into these three management aspects, to promote KAITEKI Management that increases group-wide corporate value. Of the above, we have established and adopted MOS Indexes, which in fiscal 2015 target the perfect score of 300 points, to Business Performance quantitatively monitor our performance. Of these indexes, the Sustainability Index was weak due to the impact of the deteriorated business environment facing some of the Growth Driver Businesses, including the electronics-related business. On the other hand, the Health Index and the Comfort Index were strong, and we achieved a score of 208 points for the year under review (compared to 189 points for the previous fiscal year). In fiscal 2013 we also quantified MOT Indexes on a trial basis, to monitor our progress toward achievement of our Innovation business strategy, R&D strategy, and intellectual property strategy. Furthermore, in November 2013 we established “THE KAITEKI COMPANY” as our corporate brand, striving to further increase the Group’s brand value. → Related information p.5 Sustainability Management of Sustainability (MOS) Management aiming to improve sustainability The value created from MOS MOS Axis Contributing to the resolution of a variety of environmental and social issues through corporate activities Corporate value = KAITEKI Value that consider the future of people, society, and the Earth Century Time Taking into consideration signs of the times Governance MOT Axis Management of Economics (MOE) Management which focuses on capital eﬃciency OE The value created from MOT M Decade Pursuing profits by efficiently using fro s m various forms of capital, including xi te d Management of Technology (MOT) human resources, assets and funds OE re A a Management which strives to create M alu ec innovations for society ev Quarter Financial Section Th Creating innovative products and services through the differentiation of technology that we possess In addition, the MCHC Group recently implemented a materiality assessment while taking into account the perspective of our stakeholders.

Toward a Further Increase in Shareholder Value Increasing Shareholder Returns in Line with Business Performance while Maintaining a Balance between Stable Mediumto Long-term Dividends and Internal Reserves as a Source to Fund Business Development. MCHC’s basic policy toward shareholder returns is to “Enhance shareholder value by improving corporate value,” and we strive to increase shareholder returns in line with business performance while maintaining a balance between stable mediumto long-term dividends and internal reserves as a source to fund business development. Based on this policy, we resolved to pay interim and year-end dividends for fiscal 2013 of ¥6 per share, totaling ¥12 per share for the year. In the current fiscal year, we also plan to pay ¥6 per share in both interim and year-end dividends, for a total annual dividend of ¥12 per share. At the same time, we will enhance the content of management indexes and accounting standards to provide stakeholders with a more complete understanding of our management policies and business performance, presented in a way that meets their needs. We have adopted return on assets (ROA) as one of the basic management indexes in APTSIS 15. We will also discuss an emphasis on return on equity (ROE) as a management index. Furthermore, we decided to voluntarily adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in time for the start of our next medium-term management plan (from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017), with the aim of improving the international comparability of financial information in capital markets and unify accounting throughout the Group. 18 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation KAITEKI Report 2014 Aiming to Truly Be “THE KAITEKI COMPANY” Message from the President Value The entire Group will do its utmost to address the various management issues it faces and seek to increase its corporate value and shareholder value.

Creation and Enhancement of Core Technologies Transformation Research and Development R&D Management Using the foundation of the core technologies shown MCHC set up the R&D Strategy Office in April 2014. in the diagram, the MCHC Group has set themes in The office is taking measures to further strengthen accordance with “Sustainability [Green],” “Health” the core technologies possessed by the MCHC and “Comfort,” the decision criteria for our corporate Group and pursue synergies within the Group in Business Performance activities, as the targets of our R&D. We are working R&D activities. Moreover, in order to accelerate on further strengthening our core technologies and the creation of innovation we have introduced creating new core technologies and at the same the MOT (Management of Technology) Indexes time we promote R&D by formulating R&D strategies to manage our progress quantitatively. The MOT that meet the needs of our business strategy and Indexes comprise three indexes: the R&D Index, the Examples of Innovation intellectual property strategy, so that we can intellectual property Index, and the market Index. Intellectual Property rapidly commercialize the results of our R&D. It is essential to strategically utilize intellectual capital, which is the result of R&D and Innovation so on in order to enhance our Innovation The Core Technologies of the MCHC Group MOT Indexes corporate value. For this reason the MCHC Group formulates R-1 Quality of research site for the relevant project and theme (%) and implements an intellectual property strategy for each Core technologies R&D R-2 Research progress compared with what was planned in the business.

Introducing the MOT Indexes has enabled the R&D departments and the business departments to quantitatively monitor their performances using shared evaluation items. As a result, differences between departments in perceptions of customer needs were understood, and Corporate Information we’re leading to approaches to eliminate those differences. On other hand, we have realized that R&D themes are replaced over time so it is difficult to evaluate the progress of the MOT Indexes annually with a direct function correlation. We are considering the method we should use to publish the progress of the MOT Indexes. Solving these issues, the MCHC Group will increase the number of themes to which the MOT Indexes are applicable and aiming to establish management that leads to the efficient commercialization of our R&D activities.

Management that Considers the Future of People, Society, and the Earth Management of Sustainability Based on MCHC’s original management approach called Management of Sustainability (MOS) , our group is promoting its corporate activities in order to contribute to improving sustainability for people, society, and the Earth, such as by developing technologies, providing products and services, and improving manufacturing technologies. Management of Sustainability Progress of the MOS Indexes (MOS) Indexes MCHC has set targets for each of the 22 indexes and When we started APTSIS 15, we similarly introduced evaluates their progress annually. In order to confirm the MOS Indexes, which are new management the results of MOS at a glance, we assigned weights indexes for visualizing the degree of contribution to the indexes depending on the importance of to improving “sustainability for people, society, and each one. Therefore, we can assess progress of our the Earth” in addition to the conventional financial activities based on the number of achievement In May 2006 MCHC expressed management indexes such as operating income points. Note that we set the achievement points so support for the United Nations Global Compact and return on total capital. When we established that if we achieve the targets for all of the indexes which stated 10 principles the MOS Indexes, we surveyed and analyzed a wide by fiscal 2015, the target fiscal year of APTSIS 15, in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and range of environmental and social issues that are then the total number of points will be 300.
