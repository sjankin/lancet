Even as Indian and Chinese manufacturers gain orders for similar power plants based on their low prices, biomass high-temperature, high-pressure power boiler plants built by Takuma and made possible by its extensive experience, track record of success, and exceptional technological skill are attracting a significant amount of attention in the industry. In the future, we will work to establish a pioneering position in the supply of power boiler plants that use renewable energy. Sugarcane Biomass high-temperature, high-pressure generating boiler plant In Southeast Asia’s sugary-refining industry, there has been a noteworthy shift from comparatively high-capacity, lowand medium-pressure boiler plants used to supply steam for the production process in conventional plants to power and cogeneration plants using medium-capacity, high-temperature/high-pressure biomass boilers fueled primarily with bagasse. This transition has two goals: first, to improve productivity by making effective, rational use of residual biomass from agricultural and forest products; and second, to contribute to society by supplying surplus power to the grid, made possible by using renewable energy efficiently. This section of the report introduces a bagasse-fired high-temperature, high-pressure power boiler plant at a utility company located next to a sugar refinery in Thailand. The plant began commercial operation in February 2014 after being completed on schedule by Takuma. Takuma is committed to making an even more extensive contribution to society by building products for biomass mixed-fuel power plants and supplying more power plants that use renewable energy to customers in the countries of Southeast Asia. 21 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2014 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2014 22 Business Development ⑥ Activities of Our Water Treatment Business Takuma is focused on providing characteristic technologies and developing revolutionary new technologies to aid in Actively utilizing renewable energy protecting the water environment, actively utilizing renewable energy, and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Although sewage sludge is a type of biomass and theoretically can be used as renewable energy, conventional sludge incinerator designs required an auxiliary fuel and were consumers of electricity. Takuma is working to develop and bring to Initiatives to protect the water environment market a system that would actually create energy based on a new design concept.

Those views, along with the reflections of our site foreman, are from the Great East Japan Earthquake. provided below. Takuma’s work processing disaster waste properly by installing and operating these temporary incinerators was completed in FY2013. This project enabled us to make a contribution, however slight, to the reconstruction of disaster-damaged areas. Fukushima Office for Environmental Restoration, Tohoku Regional Environmental Office, Project outline Michihiro Sakai Ministry of the Environment Item Iwate Prefecture (Miyako district) Miyagi Prefecture (Iwanuma processing district) Name FY2013: Contract to operate and manage a Operation of a Temporary Incinerator as Part of Disaster Waste This project had an extremely tight schedule, requiring the construction of three temporary incinerator in the Miyako district Processing Operations in Miyagi Prefecture (Watari-Natori Block incinerators in just four months. Despite the short construction timeline, Takuma Contributing to Society through [Iwanuma Processing District]) completed the work without accident or incident. I think this fact highlights the extent Client Iwate Prefecture Consortium consisting of Hazama Ando, Okuda, Uenogumi, of the contribution made by Takuma’s site representatives and supervising engineers. Our Businesses and Products Haruyama Construction, and Sato Construction Although incinerator performance is important when you’re incinerating waste Location Miyako City, Iwate Prefecture Iwanuma City, Miyagi Prefecture products, the most important thing is that the incinerators in question can be used to Material processed Disaster waste (waste lumber, flammable bulk waste, Disaster waste (wood chips, waste plastic, flammable bulk waste) safely process the target waste. Operational management is critical in the incineration waste plastic, tatami, blankets, etc.) of disaster waste. In the operational management of these facilities, our top priority Facility capacity Fixed bed stoker: 95 tons per 24 hrs (47.5 tons per Fixed bed stoker: 100 tons per 24 hrs (50 tons per 24 hrs×2 furnaces) was safe operation and accident prevention. In particular, it was imperative for us to 24 hrs × 2 furnaces) Kiln furnace: 95 tons per 24 hrs (95 tons per 24 hr × 1 furnace) prevent occupational accidents while absolutely avoiding any dispersion of radioactive Operations Acceptance of disaster waste and operational control, Operational control, maintenance, and oversight of temporary substances during the incineration process. We gave Takuma strict instructions on this maintenance, and oversight of temporary incinerator incinerator point. Ultimately, Takuma was able to comply with those instructions to a remarkable Total processed About 55,000 tons About 62,000 tons quantity degree. Plant manufacturers can solve issues associated with waste processing, bolster the techniques that make up their solutions, and lay the groundwork for future growth by Item Fukushima Prefecture (Soma City and Shinchi Town) working together with customers to solve problems and create knowledge. By forming Name Operation of Temporary Incineration Plants to Process Disaster Waste from the Great East Japan Earthquake on Behalf of the Japanese Government (in the City of Soma and the Town of Shinchi), FY2013 such a foundation for growth, they can not only sell plants, but also strengthen their competitive advantage and increase the competitiveness of their products by packaging Client Ministry of the Environment them with waste processing expertise. I believe that this capability is a good match for Location Soma City, Fukushima Prefecture both customer needs and the business environment, in which orders for waste Material processed Disaster waste (waste lumber, flammable bulk waste, waste plastic, tatami, blankets, etc.) processing facilities now routinely take the shape of DBO projects, including operational Facility capacity Step grate stoker: 300 tons per 24 hrs (150 tons per 24 hrs × 2 furnaces) management. Rotary grate stoker: 270 tons per 24 hrs (270 tons per 24 hrs × 1 furnace) I also believe that the way Takuma aided the recovery effort in Fukushima through its Operations Acceptance of disaster waste and operational control, maintenance, and oversight of temporary incinerator acceptance and execution of this project perfectly embodies the spirit of CSR in Total processed About 82,000 tons (as of March 31, 2014) leveraging its technical expertise to accommodate the needs of society. Takuma’s quantity contribution is a significant one for which I am truly grateful. Going forward, I trust that Takuma will continue to play a pioneering role in meeting the needs of society as a leading waste processing company. Katsumi Umezawa Manager, Soma Office, Takuma Co., Ltd. This project attracted significant attention from various quarters because it was the first alternate processing project set up by the Japanese government for disaster waste. I felt an enormous sense of responsibility and approached our operations with a certain amount of tension. Even so, I think our greatest accomplishment was to complete the processing of disaster waste on schedule and in an accidentand incident-free manner, as Mr. Sakai noted in his feedback. I feel that achievement is the result of close communication with the customer and the hard work of our site workers. We hired more than half of those site workers locally, and the enthusiasm with which they approached the task of learning about disaster waste incinerators, which are a special type of plant, was impressive. Such incinerators occasion a certain amount of unease on the part of the residents of nearby areas. I believe it is incumbent upon us as the operator of the plant to work with the customer to eliminate that unease by disclosing a full range of monitoring data and other information, starting with the concentration of radioactive substances in exhaust gases.

Against this backdrop, the environmental science and new energy science development capabilities that we have cultivated over many years lie at the heart of our CSR management. These capabilities comprise our greatest strength in that they allow us to make broad contributions to society in the tumultuous times of the 21st century. To become a sustainable, forward-looking company while fostering and expanding a broader range of CSR activities, we began compiling, implementing, and improving a CSR activity roadmap in FY2011. ● Activity report for FY2013 The following table evaluates our FY2013 plan and outlines remaining issues.

TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2014 36 CSR Activities for the Future It is important that CSR activities spread from the top of the organizational structure down and to employees. At Takuma, we held companywide discussions about which CSR issues we hold to be important and why we feel that way. Those results are summarized below. By their nature, CSR activities are long-running, sustained efforts. We believe that it is important to put them into practice in line with a roadmap and to carry them out steadily one step at a time, starting with what is possible with a view toward the future and always striving to continue and improve them, so that a sustained program can be implemented over time. Takuma strives to contribute to society through the implementation of honest, good-faith CSR activities by all employees acting together in a way that values its core business.

From a global standpoint, this is Mr. Uno: It seems to me that we need to develop more advanced methods for generating electricity from waste products. unique. In Europe, facility operaMr. Takeda: When you generate power from waste, you’re creating electricity from a variety of materials with non-uniform tors recovered energy from the properties. That lack of uniformity means that it’s not possible to generate electricity at a high level of beginning.

It’s the most natural thing in the world to achieve high generating efficiency has a hot, humid, subtropical using high-quality fuel, but surely you could more actively promote the fact that your plants can generate climate with a rainy season. electricity using fuel with non-uniform properties. We need breakthroughs in both technology and social Organic matter rots readily, systems. and bacteria reproduce quickly. Mr. Kobatake: Lifestyles in Japan are changing. How should waste treatment accommodate those changes? Other countries in Asia are Mr. Takeda: For example, there is the problem of population demographics.

Oddly, incineration technology that was developed in Europe, where the level tions consist of a majority of senior citizens is increasing. There are instances where local governments of humidity is comparatively low, was introduced to Japan. As a result, sanitary treatment that relied upon cannot get to those villages to collect garbage, spurring serious discussions on how to handle the problem. heat to kill microbes was the correct answer. However, it’s a fact that people’s lives have changed greatly. The only option is for everyone to study possible solutions.

It’s important to use that garbage carefully as the then build mechanisms that will be accepted by society. By doing so, environmental technology will provide resource that it is.

I think it’s strange to have an going forward. energy policy that was developed based on demand. I believe that energy is something that people are going to use to the extent that they can with peace of mind. I think we’ve gotten it backwards in our belief that we have to find enough resources to meet the current level of energy demand. There are lights on Response from Takuma everywhere in Japan, but personally, I don’t see the need to keep things so bright. Mr. Uno: So you’re saying that people’s awareness of the need to economize and save energy has weakened. The evolution of municipal solid waste treatment over time in response to changes in the social environment and Mr. Takeda: Ultimately, I think the answer is both to save energy and use renewable energy. It goes without saying that the needs of society has included sanitary treatment, accommodation of growing waste volume, more sophisticated we will need to take creative steps until we can transition to renewable energy. And I think that the best treatment methods, promotion of the use of recycled resources, and efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. thing would be to eliminate fossil fuel use, to zero it out. It won’t be as easy as that, but we can’t claim to Takuma has accumulated technology and expertise in the area of waste treatment through its extensive plant delivery be a sustainable society if we don’t transition to renewable energy. and DBO project operation experience. Going forward, we will continue to strive to build waste treatment systems Mr. Uno: If Japan is to ensure sustainability, it would be ideal for it to use independent sources of renewable energy that meet the needs of society while keeping an eye on future changes. rather than bringing fuel in from abroad. 39 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2014 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2014 40 Stakeholder Dialog waste can be used most Kenji Yamaji effectively and how to Director-General (Research Laboratory), Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth handle unused resources Participants from Takuma: before they are disposed of Yoshitada Kakuta Manager, Technology Planning & Administration Department as waste.

Additionally, Mr. Yamaji: My area of specialization is energy systems CO2 isn’t the only greenhouse gas; there are others such as methane and N2O. One approach is to use the engineering. During my time as a graduLCA technique to analyze reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but I think evaluation that addresses ate student, I carried out research into whole systems is important when developing a business. Stakeholder issues posed by the long-term nuclear Mr. Kakuta: There are examples of using LCA to carry out a system comparison based on garbage alone, but the effort was not particularly broad in its scope. Was global warming responsible for the way your interest has shifted Dialog fuel cycle, for example various ways that plutonium can be used in nuclear reacfrom “large” energy such as nuclear power to “small” energy such as biomass? tors. Then, rather than “hard” research, I Mr. Yamaji: Yes, that’s exactly the case. When you evaluate technologies, it is important to evaluate them by comparison investigated evaluation of energy techwith, and to combine them with, renewable energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gasses, like nologies and policy analysis. Moving into nuclear power. By combining a variety of energy sources, you can create a system that is greater than the the 1990s, as global warming became a sum of its parts. In addition, there are numerous different types of renewable energy and biomass, so it’s serious problem, I conducted research important to look at them from a cross-cutting perspective. into topics such as the development of Mr. Uno: There is currently high demand for biomass boilers that operate under the provisions of Japan’s feed-in tariff optimal energy scenarios in the context of (FIT) system for renewable energy. How do you feel about these facilities? global warming countermeasures by Mr. Yamaji: The FIT system is being underwritten by the public, so I’d like to see renewable energy used in an efficient developing an energy model targeting manner. Additionally, I think biomass deserves consideration because it also involves promotion and develthe entire world. Part of that work has opment of industry, for example in the form of revitalization of the local forestry industry. However, while it included evaluating technologies being would be a good thing if this program were to prove useful for developing Japan’s mountains, I have my developed by RITE for combatting global doubts as to whether all this can be accomplished with the FIT system. These things are the job of the warming, for example CO2 capture and Forestry Agency. Alternatively, I think there are ways to accomplish the same objectives by having local sequestration technologies. residents pool their brainpower and knowledge and address these challenges themselves. Mr. Kakuta: How did you become involved with Takuma? Mr. Kakuta: What are your expectations for biomass as far as Takuma goes? Mr. Yamaji: My relationship with Takuma began with use of biomass. Biomass is one type of renewable energy, but it Mr. Yamaji: I assume that Japan will enjoy stable growth, but the population is declining, which will prevent major differs from other renewable energy sources in that it consists of objects. Naturally, biomass also emits CO2 growth. I think that developing biomass businesses where there are ample biomass resources, for example when it burns, but since those emissions consist of CO2 that was fixed from the atmosphere by plants and in Southeast Asia, which can be expected to grow rapidly, will be important in enabling Japanese companies trees at most several decades ago, the process is carbon neutral∗. The interesting thing about biomass as a to grow. There are various aspects to biomass that go further than just use as an energy source. I think it is research topic from a systems engineering point of view is that biomass is used not only as energy, but also necessary that the policymaking process give consideration not only to the value of biomass as electricity, as material for various purposes and food. By virtue of being used as an object, that material does not use but also to its impact on other sectors such as forestry and agriculture. I think Takuma is involved with an up its energy value. When biomass is consumed as food, energy remains in excreta even if some of that extremely important business that lies at the boundary between a recycling-based society and a low-carbon energy is absorbed in the form of nutrients. In this way, I made a comprehensive analysis of various biomass society. uses as energy flows. It is in this area that I developed a relationship with Takuma. In particular, sugarcane ∗ Carbon neutral: An approach that means the CO2 emissions from burning plants and plant-based bioethanol are offset by the CO2 that is absorbed can be used as sugar, but the energy of bagasse can also be used. When I heard that sugar-refining plants by photosynthesis during the plants’ growth process, resulting in no net effect on the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. use bagasse as a source of energy, I went to Okinawa to see for myself. Plants in Okinawa also process waste molasses and other material into ethanol, while in Brazil they produce ethanol from the sucrose used to make sugar itself. Biomass is interesting because it can be used as food, burned to generate electricity, or utilized as fuel. Mr. Kakuta: We have delivered numerous biomass plants to sugar-refining plants in the Nansei Islands, Okinawa, and Response from Takuma Southeast Asia. Mr. Yamaji: I was extremely interested to find that Takuma handles biomass and that instead of simply treating waste Takuma’s technology for efficiently incinerating biomass, which does not burn readily due to its high moisture and sewage, you have made a business of capturing useful energy from those sources so as to combine material content, has earned high praise. Going forward, we will continue to work to precisely assess the needs of society and recycling and effective use of energy. Many renewable energy sources have an attractive appearance—for customers and contribute to a resolution of associated issues. example, sunlight and wind power—but in reality it’s of key importance to ask how biomass that has become 41 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2014 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2014 42 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Risk Management Structure In order to accelerate management decision-making and clarify where management responsibilities are placed, we have Takuma follows a “Risk Management Policy” that connects company-wide risks and separately classifies them into adopted an operating officer system in which we appoint operating officers who are entrusted with the responsibility to “project risks” related to our core business, i.e., plant construction, “DBO project risks” and “DBO project operation, execute our business activities.
