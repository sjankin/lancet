Corporate social responsibility must be a constant effort, but while this is so, it must also be a dynamic process responding to any new trends in the economy, new business environment, new technologies being implemented, and new communications tools. We must incorporate our values and standards into these new processes, which is not always easy – even the legislation does not always keep up with the changing environment. The Ethics Officer responds to any reported instances of non-compliance with the values, in a manner demonstrating impartiality and objective judgement. The Officer’s responsibilities include analysing employees’ ethical dilemmas in relation to their work, and clarifying problem situations that occur in their interactions with others. The Officer also provides support to employees in difficult issues of an ethical nature, and during individual meetings educates them on such matters as good communication and respecting people’s dignity. Building proper attitudes is an ongoing process due to, amongst other things, generational changes. The Ethics Officer is not the only one responsible for this process.

Adam Czyżewski Chief Economist PKN ORLEN Because we associate risk with danger, we try to avoid risk altogether. In business, we opt for tried and tested solutions because they offer a greater degree of security. Is choosing such solutions a better development strategy than innovating? New, innovative business ideas are characterised by unpredictability. Investments in such ideas can only be made under certain economic conditions. Such conditions are created by the State. One of these is a well-formulated bankruptcy law so that when a plan collapses in ruins, it does not also bury its creator. Such law has a decisive influence on the number of start-ups trying to put fresh ideas into practice. However, this alone is not enough to encourage investment in the unknown. Another condition is the development of a financing system for high-risk business projects. As a rule, start-up owners have insufficient funds for their projects, and have to rely on external sources of financing. However, no bank will give credit for ideas which cannot be compared with anything else. Start-ups must then look for financing outside the banking system, and so typically thrive in countries where such funding is available. The most developed countries are also the most innovation-friendly, and this is where most ground-breaking ideas originate in and spread throughout the world. They are purchased by developing countries, who prefer off-the-shelf solutions over having to invest in their own technologies, to grow faster and at a lower cost. This strategy also worked for Poland when it was a lowand middle-income economy per capita. With imported technologies, we have modernised the economy and outperformed others in terms of income growth, and today we belong to the group of countries having a high per capita income. It is a sign, and it is about time to shift the focus of our development strategy from ’modernisation’ to ’innovation’. If we can buy a given technology, so can others, and then the only competitive advantage of such a development model is created by the low cost of labour. We are therefore facing a strategic choice: to be competitive in labour costs, and return to the group of middle-income countries, or to be competitive with our own technologies entailing the creation of an innovative company and economy. 12 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2013 • 10 YEARS OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING Risks related to changes in existing laws and regulations In November 2012, the Supervisory Board of PKN ORLEN at three legislative levels: approved the PKN ORLEN’s strategy for 2013–2017, • EU directives and regulations applicable to ORLEN ‘Growth based on solid fundamentals’, which envisages: Group companies, particularly EU legislation • Consistent growth of the dividend yield up to 5%, concerning power generation, the natural • Value creation in the Refining, Petrochemicals and environment and climate change; Retail segments (downstream) – focus on improving • acts implementing individual EU directives and poliefficiency and maximising value, as well as using existcies into national legislation, for which individual ing potential to leverage value creation in the Power member states still have a high degree of autonomy; and Upstream segment, • national and local regulations and legislation. • Pursuit of these strategic goals while at the same time maintaining solid financial security (20%–40% The market risks include: financial leverage). • Currency risk – a significant portion of our oil product sales are valued in USD, or by reference to USD, Refining segment while prices of most of our petrochemical products are expressed in EUR, or are EUR-indexed.

That entails the need for constant dialogue with customers, employees and suppliers. By paying attention to what they have to say, acting ethically and assuming responsibility for social and environmental impact, a company builds its relational, human, social and intellectual capital. It also needs to manage the entire spectrum of risk arising from the complexity of the various interdependencies and interactions, including the impact of the non-financial aspects of its activities on its financial performance. In an integrated approach, various types of capital, not only financial, contribute to building company value. This process often leads to solutions that open doors to new products, services, or cost efficiencies and, as a consequence, improvement of financial results. Responsible conduct vastly contributes to building high company value, and therefore it translates into measurable benefits. 18 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2013 • 10 YEARS OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING CSR at PKN ORLEN YEAR ACTIVITY 1999 • PKN ORLEN participates in the Responsible Care programme, joined in 1997 by PKN ORLEN’s legal predecessor, Petrochemia Płock S.A. • Programme for providing support to fire brigades • Local partnership in Płock, support for social activities • The Petrochemical Industry for Children Foundation 2000 • Cooperation initiative with the ’SOKÓŁ’ Society for Wild Animals is launched 2001 • The ORLEN – GIFT FROM THE HEART Foundation is established 2002 • The ’Forum for Płock’ cross-sectoral partnership programme is initiated 2003 • PKN ORLEN joins Global Compact, an initiative launched by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan • PKN ORLEN’s first CSR Report is published 2004 • The Museum of Oil and Gas Industry in Bóbrka Foundation is established • An Employee Volunteering Programme is initiated 2005 • The ’PKN ORLEN Code of Ethics’ is implemented • All the corporate governance principles promoted by the WSE are adopted by PKN ORLEN • The ’Grant Fund for Płock’ Foundation is established 2006 • The Ethics Officer is elected • First edition of the ’ORLEN − Safe Roads’ campaign is held • Cooperation with the ’Good Neighbourhood Grant Fund for Ostrów Wielkopolski’ Association 2007 • The social part of the VITAY programme is launched – the credits collected as part of the programme can be donated for the benefit of family group homes • Declaration of support to the Responsible Care Global Charter is signed by PKN ORLEN 2008 • The Company Collective Bargaining Agreement is signed • The ’PKN ORLEN Charitable Giving Policy’ is adopted by the Company’s Management Board • PKN ORLEN’s service stations begin to serve Fairtrade certified coffee 2009 • PKN ORLEN qualifies for the RESPECT Index • A scholarship programme for students from the city of Płock is launched 2010 • The ’Green Energy’ Investment Programme is launched at the Płock Production Plant • The Integrated Management System is implemented • A scholarship programme for students from the County of Płock is launched 2011 • The ’Declaration on Sustainable Development in the Energy Sector in Poland’ is signed by PKN ORLEN • A new eco-friendly installation is placed in service at the Płock Production Plant • The ’Declaration of Compliance with the Code of Corporate Responsibility’ is signed • A fan page of the ORLEN – GIFT FROM THE HEART Foundation − ’Debeściaki’ − is started 2012 • The ‘The Core Values and Standards of Conduct of PKN ORLEN’ is adopted by the Management Board • A new IT system is implemented at the Płock Production Plant for the monitoring, reporting, and forecasting of CO2 emissions • Amazing People – PKN ORLEN’s new social fan page on Facebook is launched • The Masters of Chemistry scholarship programme is initiated 2013 • PKN ORLEN organises the ‘Poles with Verve’ internet poll • PKN ORLEN organises the ORLEN Warsaw Marathon • The ’ON THE PODIUM’ scholarship programme for children from family group homes having talent in sport is launched • ‘Get Excited about Helping’ – an environmental and social project to collect plastic bottle tops is organised as part of the Responsible Care programme 19 PKN ORLEN S.A. – DIRECTLY RELATED COMPANIES as at December 31st 2013 PKN ORLEN S.A.

Good agreement, despite the differences, is an important foundation of success for a company operating on international markets. The ORLEN Group considers enhancement of intercultural understanding as a strategic issue for its success. Therefore, we decided to actively engage in research on mutual perceptions between representatives of cultures in the countries where we are present. The effect is pioneering research, publications and open meetings devoted to the discussion of issues concerning intercultural relations. We act not only for our own benefit, as the results of our work are published in the public domain, accompanied by translations into foreign languages. In this way, the circle supporting the mutual relations is being extended to include central and local administration authorities, businesses that operate, similarly to the ORLEN Group, in the international marketplace, as well as representatives of the academic world. What we do sets the direction for building value through the improvement of intercultural relations. We believe that these initiatives will allow all of us to use the benefits of easier and more effective cooperation.

Because sport teaches us consistency and perseverance. I believe it adds value to things we do every day, like work, school and everyday chores. After many years of professional sport I strongly believe that sport also helps us build mental strength. It brings joy with every success, but also teaches us how to face failure. Sport also teaches us rules of fair play. It is worth remembering that while practising sport we do something important for ourselves. First of all, we take care of our health. Next, we get the chance to meet new people and build closer relationships with colleagues and friends that we already know. In busy periods, when our daily routine limits contact with others to short messages on social networks, it is good to sometimes indulge ourselves with the pleasures and joys of shared sports activities. Running events, growing in popularity now, attract a range of participants. But do remember it is not the distance run or time achieved that is important here. What is important is to share the joy of running, overcome your weaknesses, and achieve your goals.

This motto encompasses a full array are strictly defined and compliance with these rules of our projects and initiatives. is monitored to ensure the highest quality. At those service stations which sell food and drinks, we have implemented a HACCP system ensuring a systematic approach to the identification and mitigation of risks relating to the sales of food. The main products sold at the stations are fuel and food as well as restaurant services. We are aware that we are responsible for customer health and safety. Product quality Marek is assessed by way of internal audits as well as by external Balawejder bodies and inspection services. We also thoroughly analyse feedback from our customers at the stations. Executive Director for Retail Sales PKN ORLEN and Bliska stations offer drivers a growing PKN ORLEN range of services. Our restaurant services are developing rapidly. We also provide clean and free toilets. Service quality, ensured by the people who work at our Top service standards at PKN ORLEN stations are service stations, it is our great asset. As many as 93% taken for granted. Nonetheless, we want to offer of customers highlight our staff’s competence, and our customers something more – a nice and friendly in particular their commitment, willingness to help, courtesy atmosphere. This is why politeness and willingness and kindness. 96% of our customers say they are satisfied to help are the qualities we consider in addition with the fuel offered at the service stations, the shop, the car to professionalism when hiring staff for our stations wash and additional facilities at the stations. and later during training and incentive programmes.

At large facilities, we provide special toilets for people with disabilities. At smaller stations, without sufficient space, appropriate facilities are installed in one of the available toilets. 45 Service development at the PKN ORLEN retail chain PKN ORLEN fuel stations are a place where customers can not only refuel or shop in the stores, but also safely rest, have a coffee and eat a hot meal. We are continually expanding the food and drink offering of our stations – excellent Fairtrade coffee, hot drinks, crispy hot dogs, oven-fresh baked goods, grilled sandwiches, etc. For children we have launched the ‘Mini Menu’ offering – a set put together on request with juice and a selected toy. Many stations offer additional services such as ATMs, lottery outlets, driver showers, baby changing tables, separate bars, etc. At more than 650 ORLEN stations, customers can now collect, and in the future they will also be able to send, parcels 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. This new service – a novelty in the domestic market – is already well proven in Western Europe. Customers’ contribution to improvements at the stations Service quality is periodically and thoroughly monitored from a customer point of view. PKN ORLEN works with an external market research company whose ‘mystery shoppers’ make anonymous purchases at the stations, evaluate the ser vice, and record obser vations on the station’s operation. This information is used to improve service quality. We also plan on introducing a system to allow and encourage customers to directly share their opinions on service quality in an easy way (via the Internet). A very important channel of communication with customers is also our complaints handling system. Complaints are registered at the station’s head office, and communication with customers is supported by an external call centre. Complaint processing involves many people – from station managers to regional managers, to head office specialists – who analyse the complaint and issue conclusions and recommendations. All feedback from our customers is taken extremely seriously, and the information is used not only for making business decisions, but also to motivate the people managing the stations. 46 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2013 • 10 YEARS OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING Why work alone is not enough? It is not only at work where PKN ORLEN retail employees show competence together with social sensitivity. In 2013, all retail employees and invited guests were involved in the renovation of the children’s home in Tczew. Divided into task teams, they performed work including the renovation of the interior, landscaping, fence repainting, and construction of a new playground. During the work, the children were invited to take part in special activities organised for them. Thanks to the efforts and generosity of sponsors, the children’s home was equipped with new furniture and toys. This project was inspired by the activities undertaken for children’s homes in the region under the management of Łukasz Kmiecik. Łukasz Kmiecik Manager Regional Sales Team – Pomerania Dominika Komorowska Sales Manager Regional Sales Team – Pomerania PKN ORLEN We always seek a balance between work, cooperation, friends, family, and activities not always directly related to business. We have been helping children for 10 years, and renovation of children’s homes has become a permanent fixture in our calendar. The principal idea is to combine our own labour, team work and integration. Business is not only about numbers, contracts and sales growth, but primarily it is about PEOPLE. Without them, even the largest and richest organisations would not survive on the market in the long term. Through working together for children in children’s homes, the whole team learns to cooperate and seek out new solutions, which has a positive team building effect. Thus by helping children we help ourselves :). We are lucky to work for a company that has such strong values and moral principles. This approach ensures understanding from our superiors and enables us to act and help many people. In 2014, we changed some of the principles in the retail segment and we are going to Train and Help children. We plan a day of sports training (300 people) and assembling bicycles, and hope to be able to ‘put together’ 60 bicycles for children from family group homes. Of course, during this time there will be a lot of fun activities for children, safe riding lessons organised free of charge by the Provincial Road Traffic Centre of Rzeszów, and talks with the Police. 300 people ‘standing up to fight’ on one day will represent the power and the strong image of our company. Such initiatives provide help, give joy and take us up to higher levels in day-to-day business and in a number of other projects. On top of all this, our Company heavily promotes sport, including the easiest and healthiest one – running. We want more people to get involved, so we encourage you to get out and go jogging. It may seem odd to some, but sport really helps to organise the working day and makes it an easier one :). Moreover, as we become healthier, more beautiful and happier, it is easier for us to achieve better results. 47 SUPPLIERS The goal of the PKN ORLEN procurement area c) Where a difficult situation or conflict arises, is to become the best purchasing organisation in the fuel we attempt to solve the issue through dialogue and power industry of Central and Eastern Europe. with the parties involved.

Pro-environmental effects in the area of fuel production Gasolines Motor gasolines produced in 2013 by PKN ORLEN included: Eurosuper 95 Gasoline A mixture of hydrocarbons obtained from crude oil processing. It is the most basic type of gasoline offered on the Polish market. Through highest-quality additives, such as ether, alkylate and isomerizate, the required octane rating is obtained with reduced content of aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene and sulfur. All gasolines produced by PKN ORLEN contain highest-quality enhancing additives, which mainly include a detergent additive ensuring compliance with the highest engine valve cleanliness standards as defined in the Worldwide Fuel Charter. Super Plus 98 Gasoline A sublimated mixture of hydrocarbon fractions obtained from crude oil processing. The qualities of its components assure the required octane rating with a decreased content of aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene and sulfur (it must not exceed 10 ppm). VERVA 98 A virtually sulfur-free gasoline which ensures better fuel economy, higher engine performance, and high efficiency and durability of catalytic converters. It is a new generation fuel, designed to improve engine operating conditions in different weather conditions and under changing loads. A reduced sulfur content below 10 mg/kg means the fuel feed, combustion and exhaust systems are much less subject to corrosion. The fuel prolongs the operating life of exhaust fumes catalysts. It reduces hydrocarbon (CH) and carbon monoxide (CO) content in exhaust fumes. VERVA 98 has a beneficial effect on the engine’s lifetime, increasing the mechanical durability of its components (cylinders, pistons, rings and valves). The combustion process of VERVA 98 is additionally improved through a custom-blended package of optimally-dosed cleaning additives (detergents) which guarantee the cleanliness of the inlet system and even eliminate deposits left by fuels of unknown origin which do not contain such detergents. It is anticorrosive with antioxidant properties and protects the stored fuel from degradation. 49 Motor gasolines by quality and type in 2013 PRODUCT OUTPUT [Mg] 75,263 Super Plus 98 with ethanol and EETB content 79,784 2,179,254 Super Plus 98 with EETB EuroSuper 95 with ethanol and EETB content 125,757 VERVA 98 332,585 EuroSuper 95 AVERAGE SULFUR CONTENT ETHANOL CONTENT [%(m/m)] * [%(v/v)] 0.001 0.0008 5 4 0.0006 3 0.0004 2 0.0002 1 0 0 AVERAGE BENZENE CONTENT ETBE (ETHER) CONTENT [%(v/v)] ** [%(m/m)] 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 14 0.6 12 0.5 10 0.4 8 0.3 6 0.2 4 0.1 2 0 0 EuroSuper 95 Super Plus 98 with ethanol and EETB content Super Plus 98 with EETB EuroSuper 95 with ethanol VERVA 98 and EETB content * In accordance with the Minister of the Economy Regulation of May 10th 2013, concerning the publication of the consolidated text of the Minister of the Economy Regulation on the quality requirements applicable to liquid fuels (Dz.U. of September 11th 2013, item 1058) – the maximum sulfur content in motor gasolines to be used for vehicles equipped with positive-ignition engines is 10 mg/kg. ** In accordance with the Minister of the Economy Regulation of May 10th 2013, concerning the publication of the consolidated text of the Minister of the Economy Regulation on the quality requirements applicable to liquid fuels (Dz.U. of September 11th 2013, item 1058) – the maximum benzene content in motor gasolines to be used for vehicles equipped with positive-ignition engines is 1% v/v. 50 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2013 • 10 YEARS OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING In 2013, no new gasoline types were added to our product range, but the production volume of alcoholcontaining gasolines was increased. PKN ORLEN continued the production of gasolines containing biocomponents: EuroSuper 95 gasoline with alcohol and ether, Super Plus 98 gasoline with alcohol and ether, and Super Plus 98 and VERVA 98 gasolines, which meet the requirements of the Minister of the Economy, Regulation of May 10th 2013, concerning the publication of the consolidated text of the Minister of the Economy Regulation on the quality requirements applicable to liquid fuels. Diesel oils In 2013, PKN ORLEN produced the following types of diesel oil with sulfur content below 10 mg/kg [0.0010 % (m/m)]: Class 2 Ekodiesel Ultra diesel oil (ONA-2, with modified low temperature parameters for the arctic or severe winter climate) which is produced only in a few European countries under the trade name City Diesel. PKN ORLEN is its only producer in Poland. Sulfur content has been reduced to maximum 10 mg/ kg, and the content of multi ring aromatic hydrocarbons may not exceed 5% (m/m) – and is actually much lower. The product contains a number of enhancing additives which improve its operating qualities and ensure appropriate cleaning, anticorrosive, antioxidant and lubricating properties of the fuel. Like other diesel oils, Ekodiesel Ultra is protected against microbiological contamination and contains an additive increasing its cetane rating. Ekodiesel Ultra is used in road transport, especially mass transport, in large cities and environmentally protected areas. One of the advantages of this product is reduced particulate matter emissions achieved through the appropriate selection of components ensuring appropriate distillation parameters and excellent low temperature properties of the fuel, supported by the addition of a depressant. The Ekodiesel Ultra diesel oil is the highest-quality fuel that meets the most stringent quality and environmental standards expected from diesel engine fuels in the European Union. Its most important advantages include trace levels of sulfur content (below 10 mg/kg), reduced aromatic hydrocarbon content, increased cetane rating, improved properties in winter conditions, and a high level of microbiological purity. 51 Diesel oils by quality and type in 2013 PRODUCT OUTPUT [Mg] 5,990,723 Ekodiesel Ultra* 44,310 ONA-2 * Excluding diesel oil intended for storage in salt caverns.

It involves construction of catalytic denitrification and dust removal units on each boiler, as well as of a wet lime and gypsum flue gas desulfurization unit. The technologies applied in the units specified above are deemed the Best Available Techniques (BAT) in the area of reducing pollutant emissions from combustion plants. The units will ensure compliance with the emissions levels stipulated in the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED), and for the CHP plant they will be as follows (effective as of 2016): • for SO2 – 200 mg/Nm3, • for NOX – 150 mg/Nm3, • for dust – 20 mg/Nm3. To meet the Płock Production Plant’s growing requirement for energy carriers, in April 2012 we finalised the commissioning of a new 300 MWt steam boiler (K-8). The boiler obtained all the necessary approvals and was certified for use. The new K-8 boiler complies with the most stringent environmental standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides and dust, which was confirmed by warranty measurements performed by an independent, accredited measurement company. 53 54 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2013 • 10 YEARS OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING Employee 55 EMPLOYEES The human resources policy and employee management leave entitlements, social and medical benefits, and system in place at PKN ORLEN are presented in ‘Policy for fair remuneration.

Further CHP boilers will be fitted with similar installations in 2014–2016. The decline was also partly attributable to reduced CO2 emissions. 2013 was the second full year of operation of the Terephthalic Acid Production Plant (PTA Plant) in Włocławek. Year on year, its air emissions of NOX and CO increased by 40.6% and 62.0%, respectively, with CO2 emissions down 27.5%. The higher emissions followed from the need to temporarily conduct operations in abnormal conditions which were, however, permitted and provided for in the integrated permit for the PTA Plant. For more information, see table on page 11. Ambient concentration For a number of years, PKN ORLEN has been measuring air pollutant concentration at designated places around the Płock Production Plant. This measure, referred to as ‘ambient concentration’, is used to indicate the amount of windborne dust or gaseous substances, often transported over large distances, in a given volume of air. Such pollutants are mostly products of fuel combustion or technological processes. In 2013, the air emissions monitoring covered substances such as O3, CO, SO2, NO2 and BTX, and was carried out by an automatic monitoring station located outside the Płock Production Plant premises. In October of the same year, the old monitoring station was replaced with a new one. Environmental standards for all substances measured in 2013 were complied with. In 2013, the annual average concentrations of major pollutants, i.e. SO2, NO2 and benzene, were slightly lower than in 2012. 67 PKN ORLEN’s participation in the National Emissions Trading Scheme In 2013, PKN ORLEN complied with all legal and formal the number reaching 9,062,676 for the entire ORLEN requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions.
