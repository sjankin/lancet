However, with the exception of China, emerging economies, which played a pivotal role in lifting the global economy out of recession, entered a slump in 2013, and this is expected to continue into 2014. the Basics The changes brought on by the global financial crisis have either shifted or strengthened to create a whole new business environment for automakers. There have been three major shifts: markets, vehicle class, and competitive landscape. The US and China, rather than emerging economies, are driving the growth of the auto industry, and with falling sales in Europe rebounding, the gap is closing between advanced and emerging markets. Consumer preference is shifting from subcompacts to SUVs, and American and Japanese automakers have made a comeback, intensifying competition. The importance of basics—i.e., quality and fuel economy—is growing, and the green vehicle market, with hybrids driving growth, is continuing to expand.

Kia Motors Sustainability Magazine 2014 Special Feature Green: Special Feature Connecting This Generation with the Next 28 29 Following the EU’s declaration of an automotive CO2 emission reduction target of 95 g/km by 2020, the US, China, Japan, and Korea also adopted tougher emissions policies. Driving this development is the concern that the life of the planet may be finite like human life. Unfettered indulgences of the past have caught up with us, and our children’s future demands that changes are made in the present. Fuel economy sums up the green transformation sought by the automobile. There is a 99.9% inverse correlation between fuel economy and CO2 emissions, the main culprit of climate change. That is to say, higher fuel economy means lower CO2 emissions. The average CO2 emissions of new Kia models registered in the EU market in 2012 stood at 129.5 g/km, a 22.5% reduction from 167 g/km in 2004 and a 5.5% year-on-year decrease from 137 g/km in 2011. Kia Motors’ growing greenness is corroborated by such numbers. We will continue our focus on efficiency to improve the present and seek alternatives to the combustion engine for a future built on innovation.

For these reasons, HEVs boast high fuel economy especially when it comes to EcoDynamics, which embodies our commitment to contributing to the betterment of humanity and stop-and-go city driving. the earth by adding sustainable mobility to the existing value of cars, and officially embarked on our journey toward zero emissions.

The K5 (Optima) and K7 (Cadenza) hybrids are outfitted with a parallel hard-type hybrid system independently developed by Kia Motors. A hard-type HEV is only powered by the motor when traveling at low speeds, and a parallel hybrid system features a single motor that recharges the battery and powers the vehicle. Existing power-split hybrid systems have two motors, one to recharge the battery and one to supply power. By using a connecting engine clutch that puts both the engine and motor to work during acceleration, Kia succeeded in creating a single-motor hybrid system that is 1986 smaller and lighter and yet more efficient than the power-split drivetrain. Developed first The battery determines an HEV’s performance as the energy stored powers the motor.

An FCEV consists of a tank that stores hydrogen, a fuel cell stack that generates electric ever, there is a limit to the size of the battery that can go into a vehicle, so EVs can only travel power, and a battery that supplies auxiliary energy. With water as the only by-product, FCEVs some 100 km per charge. Moreover, even high-speed charging takes around 30 minutes, are completely emission-free. FCEVs are three times more energy-efficient than combustion and charging infrastructure is still lacking. Nevertheless, EVs are continuing to evolve just like engine cars, and they outdo EVs in terms of charging speed—as fast as pumping gas—and Technologies for the Future internal combustion engine cars have done for over a century.

Kia Motors Sustainability Magazine 2014 Special Feature Smart: Special Feature Connecting Life with 40 New Possibilities 41 Automotive technology today puts people first. Cars already protect people from accidents and watch over the driver, providing alerts about road conditions or going into self-driving mode. Smartphone-linked services that enable drivers to use mobile apps via the in-vehicle display will be launched this very year. Research is underway on automotive technologies that enable mood-based music selection, monitor the driver’s health condition, offer daily schedule alerts, and provide optimal routes through communication with other vehicles and traffic infrastructure. The automobile observes and analyzes everyday habits and patterns and proposes a better way of life. Driving this development are changes in the realities of daily human life brought on by today’s connected world. The world population continues to grow and age while the middle class expands and the pace of urbanization accelerates. These changes foretell a surge in the number of cars on our roads and accompanying traffic challenges. They also demand solutions to automotive and traffic challenges brought on by population aging. Kia Motors identifies social changes and the needs of the time and works with relevant industries and organizations to address them. Self-driving cars, the final destination of the automobile’s journey toward ‘smart,’ is now within reach.

When the camera on the windshield detects a lane change, LDWS alerts the driver if the turn signal is not on. LKAS, in the meantime, automatically adjusts the steering wheel to keep a vehicle in a given lane. LDP first issues a warning sound, and if the steering wheel is not adjusted, it maneuvers the vehicle back into the original lane.

And because they are continuously moving, regular customer satisfaction customer satisfaction maintenance and replacement of parts and fluids are a must. As such, automobiles and service centers are inextricably bound together. This is why Kia Motors has sophisticated systems in place for quality enhancement, and this is also why we formulated a corporate vision for quality service in 2013.

With 2014 MOVE, Kia Motors strove to follow the GRI G4 Guidelines issued in 2013 and provide coverage of those impacts that are stressed in the revised guidelines. We tried our best to detail the economic, social, and environmental factors that impact Kia Motors and the impact Kia Motors and our products have externally. For every section of the report, we provide coverage of Kia Motors’ relevant systems and activities, our perception of the relevant issue(s), and the reasons for our systems and activities. There is room for improvement as this is the first year we applied the G4 Guidelines.
