The Three Corporate Principles have been passed down the generations since the Company’s founding. These principles are Corporate Responsibility to Society (“Shoki Hoko ”), Integrity and Fairness (“Shoji Komei ”), and Global Understanding Through Business (“Ritsugyo Boeki ”). The Three Corporate Principles call upon MC to conduct fair and sound business activities by contributing to society, giving consideration to the environment, and carrying out global business activities. Under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, our previous medium-term management plan, our overarching goal was to create sustainable corporate value. We are continuing this drive under New Strategic Direction—we are working to maximize our value as a sogo shosha by striving to create sustainable economic value, societal value and environmental value. This is indeed consonant with the spirit of the Three Corporate Principles. 12 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2014 Chapter 1 Future Ken Kobayashi President and CEO 13 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2014 OverallOverview Picture of New Strategic Direction We formulated New Strategic Direction (charting a new path toward sustainable growth), as our current midterm management strategy effective from the year ended March 2014. Amidst major changes in MC’s business models and the external environment, we have abolished midterm management plans centered on three-year financial targets, in favor of a long-term, circa 2020 growth vision. To realize this vision, we have set down our “New Strategic Direction,” which consists of basic concepts on management policy together with our business and market strategies. In New Strategic Direction, we have redefined MC’s value as a sogo shosha that is capable of “providing upside potential as well as stable earnings throughout business cycles by managing a portfolio diversified by business model, industry, market and geography.” With our business models and external business environment changing dramatically, we adopted a longer time horizon, and shifted from a conventional mid-term management plan approach, to formulating a strategy based on a “future pull” approach that looks ahead to circa 2020. Our growth vision sets the goal of doubling the size of our business by around 2020. Considering the fact that the Company has both resource and non-resource fields under one roof, we have also set targets in line with the characteristics of each business. In the resource field, we aim to double our attributable equity production. This comes as we shift our focus from building a project pipeline in the previous mid-term management plan, to a stage of generating earnings from existing investments. In the non-resource field, we seek to accelerate efforts to reshape our portfolio by increasing new investments while replacing portfolio assets. Our goal is to double our earnings in the non-resource field. Guided by New Strategic Direction, we will continue aiming to create sustainable corporate value. At the same time, we will strive to maximize MC’s corporate value through efforts to optimize our portfolio and realize our growth vision.

In the non-resource field, we saw strong performances in Asian automobile-related operations, page 20. with all other business segments also achieving higher earnings year over year. Furthermore, we executed investments to drive growth as planned, and successfully replaced assets in the portfolio at a faster pace than initially anticipated. In New Strategic Direction, we set out to implement measures to maximize our value as a sogo shosha with multiple businesses spread across different fields. We are making steady progress on these measures. In the year ended March 31, 2014, the first year for laying the groundwork for New Strategic Direction, we made a strong start toward realizing our growth vision circa 2020.

Progress on Creating Sustainable Societal and Environmental Value Aiming to double the size of our business by around 2020, we are developing business activities to increase attributable equity production and earnings. As we do so, we are also expected to show even greater consideration for local communities and the global environment. Besides creating sustainable economic value, we recognize that it is now more vital than ever to create sustainable societal and environmental value through our core businesses. In April 2014, we formulated the Mitsubishi Corporation Social Charter, which outlines our basic approach to creating sustainable societal value. The Social Charter sets forth our commitment to supporting the sound development of the regions in which we operate through both our core businesses and social contribution activities. Together with the Mitsubishi Corporation Environmental Charter, which we established in 1996, the Social Charter articulates our basic approach to creating sustainable societal and environmental value. Guided by the Social Charter and the Environmental Charter, we will monitor and strive to reduce the negative impact of our business activities on local communities and the global environment, as we endeavor to contribute to the development of local communities and the preservation of the global environment for many more years to come. 15 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2014 Progress on Business Strategies Eyeing 2020, we will formulate business plans in each business segment every year on a rolling basis and adjust our strategies in step with changes in operating conditions.

Our objective is to ensure sustainable growth by capturing growth in Asia. To achieve this goal, we have appointed a Business Development Officer for Asia in each business group. We are working to expand business through two strategies. The first strategy is to secure global supply sources to meet increasing demand for raw materials and other commodities in Asia, where strong growth is expected. The second strategy is to establish a local presence within the Asian region, through M&As, strategic alliances, and other proactive initiatives. Specifically, we are working to further strengthen automobile operations in Thailand and Indonesia in order to establish a local presence in the region.

This result was 24.8 billion yen more than the forecast of 420.0 year ended March 2014? billion yen issued together with our results for the nine months ended December 2013. Net income attributable to owners of the Parent was 361.4 billion yen on an IFRS basis. (Hereinafter, all monetary amounts are stated on an IFRS basis.) In the resource field, net income attributable to owners of the Parent fell 27.7 billion yen from the year ended March 2013 to 115.4 billion yen. The main factors were decreases in dividend income from resource-related business investees and equity-method earnings, in addition to decreased earnings due to higher exploration costs. These decreases where somewhat offset by higher dividend income from overseas resource-related business investees in the Energy Business Group and higher earnings posted at an Australian resource-related subsidiary (coking coal) in the Metals Group. In the non-resource field, net income attributable to owners of the Parent rose 52.2 billion yen from the year ended March 2013 and reached a record 237.1 billion yen. Higher earnings driven by steady growth in Asian automobile operations in the Machinery Group contributed immensely to this bottom-line result. In the year ended March 2014, the ratio of net income attributable to owners of the Parent from resource and non-resource fields was 3:7, compared with 4:6 in the year ended March 2013. This ratio mainly reflected a substantial increase in earnings in non-resource fields, while the resource field saw decreased earnings from the year ended March 2013. 20 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2014 Question 2 Could you please go over Our financial strategy is to sustain growth and maximize corporate value by balancing earnthe main points of MC’s ings growth, capital efficiency and financial soundness.

After investing, we formulate a business plan every year by surveying and analyzing various factors of each investment, such as operating results, business details, and total returns and risk money. We manage the risk of each investment in order to ensure that we achieve investment goals. Meanwhile, in cases where investees do not meet certain criteria, our policy is to withdraw from investments at an early stage based on exit rules, in order to efficiently replace assets in our portfolio. This is necessary for shaping a sound investment portfolio at MC. Through this process, we recover investment funds and make new investments, with the aim of increasing our corporate value.

[ Enhancing General Meetings of Shareholders] Chapter 5 MC sends out notices of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders early and avoids dates on which many other Japanese companies schedule their meetings. In addition, MC discloses some parts of its business report on its website. These and other measures create a framework that facilitates robust deliberations by shareholders. Furthermore, since 2011, MC has collated the results of voting by shareholders in attendance at meetings on proposals and disclosed them on its website and in other ways in order to respond to requests from domestic and overseas institutional investors for detailed disclosure of voting results and to promote dialogue-based meetings with individual shareholders. Additionally, MC conducts activities for the environment. For example, for every shareholder who consents to receive materials such as meeting notices for shareholder meetings via e-mail, rather than post, MC will plant one tree per person every six months. 89 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2014 Internal Control System The demands on companies seeking to fulfill their corporate of corporate information disclosure (financial reporting) and social responsibilities are growing amid major changes in the adherence to laws and regulations and social norms (complibusiness environment such as globalization and rising interest in ance).

MC has long engaged in upholding compliance based on the Three Corporate Principles, our corporate philosophy. In September 2000, MC established the “Mitsubishi Corporation Code of Conduct,” a compilation of the Three Corporate Principles and other internal rules and regulations, which each and every officer and employee has to be mindful of. This Code of Conduct, together with the introduction of the Compliance Officer system, has laid a solid foundation for a new era of compliance. Since then, MC has continuously implemented measures to strengthen awareness and knowledge of compliance. These measures include an e-learning program that uses live examples relating to the Code of Conduct, an undertaking by each officer and employee to abide by the Code of Conduct, and seminars that foster knowledge of compliance. MC is also strengthening compliance on a Group-wide basis through the introduction of similar compliance-related regulations and systems in Group companies, the provision of support for the holding of various seminars and other measures. Recently, MC has also actively adopted new initiatives such as giving each and Jun Yanai Member of the Board, every officer and employee of MC and its Group companies, which conduct busiSenior Executive Vice President, nesses in a variety of operations and sectors, the opportunity to think about compliChief Compliance Officer ance in their daily work activities and lives, by holding “Compliance Discussions” at their respective workplaces.

Members said the incorrect predictions should serve as a warning for MC’s management about the dangers of projecting into the future trends that are evident only at a particular time and may not necessarily linger. “MC has grown into a truly global company with the world as its market,” Mr. Ratan N. Tata, Chairman of Tata Trusts, said. Mr. Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala II, Chairman and CEO of Ayala Corporation, sees the committee playing a vital role. “The IAC is a special opportunity to hear independent views on potential areas of Professor Joseph S. Nye risk, global macro-economic policies and emerging industry dynamics,” he said. U.S.: Harvard University Distinguished Service Professor 94 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2014 Capturing Growth in Asia Participants concurred on an adjustment in the balance of the world economy with the core shifting toward Asia. “The world economy is rebalancing from the West towards Asia,” KKR Asia Ltd. Chairman Sir John Bond told the IAC. IAC members were in unison on agreeing that Asia appears set to lead world economic growth moving forward. Several of the IAC members stressed the importance of capturing opportunities in Asian markets. Members concurred that the situation in China remains unclear in terms of politics and economics. All agreed that China’s market requires deft handling. Discussion also touched on several points of concern with respect to Japan and China, including further deterioration of diplomatic ties. Mr. Ratan N.Tata India: Tata Trusts Chairman U.S. Political and Economic Revival The U.S. has developed non-conventional energy sources, its population continues to grow and it carries on producing technological innovations in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, making it well poised for a revival over the mediumto long-term. Members agreed the U.S. has an advantageous position in the international community, and this appears secure for the time being. ”MC takes a very wide-ranging approach to the world and their assessment of the world strikes me as very realistic,” Professor Joseph Nye, Harvard University Distinguished Service Professor, told the IAC. Sir John Bond U.K.: KKR Asia Ltd. Chairman International Human Resource Development (HRD) and Organizational Management Decentralizing personnel and operations from Tokyo will further globalize MC. Among the initiatives planned are developing human resources from Japan-based personnel capital, expanding market coverage to focus more on the world instead of being Japan-centric and strengthening functions from being Japanese customer-oriented to applying global standards. Professor Nye lauded MC’s globalChapter 5 izing efforts, citing a recent initiative to shift part of MC’s mineral and metals resources business to Singapore. “I was very impressed to hear that metals trading is going to be run from Singapore instead of Tokyo,” he said. “That’s a sign of adapting to globalization and change, so I think this is a company which is thinking ahead.” Former Mexican Secretary of Trade & Industry Dr. Herminio Blanco Mendoza concurred. “MC has increased its competitiveness across regions and business sectors,” he said. Dr. Herminio Blanco Mendoza Mexico: Former Secretary of Trade & Industry Summary The IAC continues to afford MC valuable insight from some of the brightest minds in global politics and business. The input from this year’s meeting will undoubtedly play a key role in achieving the MC Group’s circa 2020 growth vision. Mr. Zobel spoke of IAC’s importance. “The meetings are always a chance for the leadership team to test their ideas about future directions with a select group of global advisors who have their own subjective insights about their specific global industries and respective regions.” Professor Nye declared the IAC October 2013 meeting a success. “I thought it was very good,” he said. “We have a very thoughtful group of people and we discussed some of the big issues – everything from problems in the Middle East to what’s going to happen in Europe and relations between China and Japan.

We have therefore been actively engaged in promoting a range of initiatives towards realizing a sustainable society through every aspect of our business. The cornerstone of these activities has been our Environmental Charter, which we established in 1996. This charter clearly outlines Sustainable Economic Value our basic stance regarding environmental issues to all of our stakeholders. MC revised our Environmental Charter in 2010, reflecting Creating Sustainable Aim for sound earnings growth and increased the fact that environmental awareness and issues had evolved over Corporate Value corporate value through the proactive reshaping time.

This committee is responsible for overseeing our basic Executive Committee sustainability policies and also makes recommendations to the Executive Committee. CSR & Environmental The CSR & Environmental In addition, the CSR & Environmental Affairs Advisory Committee, which Affairs Committee Affairs Advisory Committee is composed of outside experts, provides us with expertise and recommendations regarding the MC Group’s sustainability initiatives. (For details on the Advisory Committee, please see page 111.) ESG Management of Loans and Investments As part of MC’s strategic decision-making process, all loan and investment proposals are examined by our Executive Committee. The screening and review process is an extensive one, taking into account not only financial and legal risks but also environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Proposals for certain projects are examined by the Board of Directors as well. The CSR & Environmental Affairs Advisory Committee Loan and investment decisions by the Executive Committee are based on advisory input from the Investment Advisory Committee, which in turn bases its advice on comments submitted by specialized internal departments.

CSR is indispensable for a company’s sustainable development. MC as seen This is where Mitsubishi Corporation should exhibit leadership. by our There is a widespread and growing awareness that a company’s sustained Stakeholders development is linked to that company actively incorporating CSR into its Chapter 6 business. The reality is that CSR is increasingly becoming linked to how investors evaluate corporate performance. Companies must be aware that failing to convey their CSR approach in a persuasive manner runs the risk of losing out on business opportunities that would otherwise be available. General trading companies such as MC are engaged in a wide range of business operations. In order to move toward a more integrated form of reporting, I believe MC should make even more of an effort to disclose specific risks and opportunities in a manner that is as closely connected to each business as possible. Together with a thorough description of the positive aspects of value creation, it is important to also demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the negative impacts of the business in order to provide a balanced narrative of the company. Moreover, this is now a time when the efforts of a company to take the initiative in openly collaborating with Eiichiro Adachi Counselor, The Japan NGOs and other international institutions is increasingly linked to how much that company is trusted. I expect Research Institute, Limited Mitsubishi Corporation to come up with topics that are distinctively characteristic of the company, and to exhibit leadership and actively implement these types of initiatives. 101 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2014 [ Key Sustainability Themes for MC ] MC has identified the following sustainability issues as having high materiality in our business activities: addressing climate change; sustainable use of resources; the rights of indigenous peoples; preservation of biodiversity; respect for human rights, labor rights and prevention of pollution and accidents.

Chapter 6 Support through Charitable Foundations Through the Mitsubishi Corporation Foundation for the Americas (MCFA) and Mitsubishi Corporation Fund for Europe and Africa (MCFEA), MC supports a wide range of initiatives focusing on environmental conservation, education and poverty alleviation. The following introduces a number of typical initiatives in these fields.
