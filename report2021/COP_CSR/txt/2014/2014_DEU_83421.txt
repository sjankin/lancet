Since its merger in 1997 into the IG BCE (Mining, Chemical and Energy Workers’ Union), the IG BCE is the sole shareholder of the QFC. Major task of the first years was to empower people threatened by unemployment to find a new vocation and to support company reorganisation after they emerged from the former GDR collective-enterprises. Through purposeful qualification of employees the QFC made a contribution to the growth and to the promotion of economic and industrial development, and was actively involved in the structural change of the chemical industries of East Germany. Today, the QFC is an internationally operating project and training agency. Company Focus and Mission The QFC stands for the promotion of working qualifications in the chemical industries. Based on a well developed network architecture our work concentrates on four areas: First Apprentice Qualification Promotion Transfer management European competence. As a non-profit subsidiary of the Mining, Chemical and Energy Workers’ Union (IG BCE) we see ourselves primarily bearing responsibility for the employees and their enterprises at the locations which are serviced by the IG BCE. To them belong trainees, young people, who are looking for a job and unemployed people. Furthermore we support enterprises concerning vocational education, personnel development and structural adjustments. We perceive our work as providing a contribution towards innovation, sustainability, qualification, employment and co-operation in Europe. P 3/19 Actions taken to implement the Global Compact principles in the sphere of influence of the QFC For the dissemination and implementation of the Global Compact Principles in vocational education and training, the QFC has implemented its new quality standard Q3SQ in practice, during the reporting period. Q3SQ stands for Quality Standard for Social and Sustainable Qualification. The quality label Q3SQ includes a quality management, the principles of Responsible Care, as well as the principles of the Global Compact. With the quality label to both, in the learning facilities, as well as in the education and training activities, the Global Compact Principles shall be implemented and also imparted to the participants in training and further training. In May 2011 the quality label Q3SQ of the QFC was presented at a conference with representatives of ministries, companies, works councils, trade unions, employers and training providers and awarded for the first time publicly at the following educational institutions: Bildungszentrum Wolfen-Bitterfeld e.V. aus Bitterfeld-Wolfen Ausbildungsverbund Olefinpartner e.V. aus Schkopau Bildungszentrum für Beruf und Wirtschaft e.V. aus Lutherstadt Wittenberg BAL Bildungsakademie Leuna GmbH & Co KG /IBLM Interessengemeinschaft Bildung Leuna-Merseburg e.V. These four educational institutions are training approx. 1300 participants for about 325 companies in their education and further training activities. In the first half of 2012 Q3SQ certified training providers had created their first annual reports on the implementation of Q3SQ. In 2014 re-certifications have taken place at the educational institutions. A jury of three representatives from science and the IG BCE is currently evaluating the audit documents and will take a decision on further certification. The decision of the jury is the relevant recommendation for the award of Q3SQ for another three years. The Q3SQ-certified training providers and the Provadis partner for consulting and training GmbH also TÜV Rheinland Akademie GmbH are developing within the project CaeSaR training modules for Sustainability, the Global Compact principles and CSR for practical use in the education and training. (GRI -SO5) CaeSaR (CSR activities for ethical and social solutions to create an innovative work environment and for sustainable use of resources) is a joint project of the QFC, the IG BCE, BWS and the IG BCE Foundation “Work and Environment”. The project period is from 01.01.2012 to 31.12.2014. P 4/19 The project is part of the CSR program of the BMAS (Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) “CSR in SMEs for small and medium-sized enterprises and supports the implementation of the “Action Plan CSR (National strategies for corporate social responsibility)” of the Federal Government. The Caesar project is aimed at corporate actors and at the relevant social partners. As a part of the project, the basics of CSR, including national and international initiatives (such as the Global Compact), will be disseminated, concrete points of action in the fields of the labour, environmental, market and community will be identified and corporate CSR projects are initiated. In addition, a training program for CSR promoters is developed and implemented and offered accompanying CSR consultation. As part of the project was a study Social Responsibility for SME’s introduction to the topic of corporate social responsibility for companies in the organizational area of the Mining, Chemical and Energy Worker’s Union Mining was published with best-practice examples and a CSR analysis tool.

The project started in 2010 at the suggestion of the Department of Women / Gender IG BCE, together with the QFC , in cooperation with the BAVC with funding from the ESF and the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (BMAS) and was terminated on 30.04.2013 . The main objective of the project is to test measures in personnel development, so that female workers are strengthened and supported in their career orientation and willingness and to network with all social actors and stakeholders in the implementation of equal opportunities. During the reporting period 96 events with 1133 participants took place. In addition, 5 project or control teams, which met regularly, analyzed the situation in the companies and established targeted measures in the factories. Overall, a network was established with 220 multipliers that is maintained and accompanied over the project period beyond. A monograph under the title of success stories presented experiences of successful women and illuminated promoting and inhibiting factors for career advancement of women. (GRI LA13, GRI SO5) Since May 2005 the QFC is a member of the Network for Democracy and Tolerance in Saxony-Anhalt and it regularly participates in events organized by the Alliance.

The project runs in 9 major companies in the mining, energy industry, chemical industry, paper industry and water utilities based in the states of Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The project is running from 01.04.2011 to 30.06.2014. A total number of 196 participants were involved in the training for women in leadership position. (GRI-LA11, GRI-LA13, GRI-SO5) The QFC project Mobility without Barriers (MOBA) has the goal to improve employment opportunities for unemployed young people and adults with difficulties to find work through the promotion of transnational exchange and mobility projects. These groups of people with difficult access to the labor market gain work experience in other EU countries, improve their foreign language skills, enhance their social and intercultural skills. The activities are inter alia carried out in cooperation with three local job centers. As part of the project internships abroad (lasting one month) take place in Poland or Denmark. Following this, the internships are evaluated in a three-week follow-up. Participants will receive support at this stage in their job search. In the project period from 01.04.2011 to 30.06.2014 a total of 120 participants will take part in 11 separate rounds. So far, four rounds with 28 participants have taken place. At the end of the operational duration of the project at 31.03.2014, 95 participants have completed an internship in the European countries. (GRI-LA11, GRI-SO5) The QFC Project MILENA (module concept to acquire international professional competence in northern Saxony-Anhalt) prepares apprentices preparing for the transition from training to working life, so they can meet the challenges of the second threshold. The particular strength of this project is that in the context of a mobility module it contributes to the internationalization of vocational training and provides apprentices the ability to complete training components in Europe (especially Great Britain, Ireland, Poland, France, Italy) and to improve foreign language skills in order to acquire international professional competence. In cooperation with local training and education providers, the module concept will contribute to build cross-industry, international cooperation between training institutions and integrate concepts to acquire international professional competences in vocational training. The project includes 585 apprentices in the period from 10.01.2011 to 30.09.2014. So far already 693 apprentices were able to complete seminars for achieving international professional action competence. (GRI-LA11, GRI-SO1) The QFC project DemTV (implementation of demography collective agreements) aimed at the empowerment of consensus-oriented implementation and -action options between the social partners in order to establish a demography firm personnel policy. On the basis of collective agreements concluded in the chemical, rubber, plastics and with restrictions in the paper industry, the pressure for action is increasing in the companies. P 13/19 With DemTV an intensive implementation initiative was initiated and supported by the network, the Advisory Board and the multipliers. Based on present demographic analyzes the collective agreement “working life and demography” were in the center of the project. The objective of the project was succeeded: to present the topics beyond the compulsory demographics like age-appropriate job design. That should give suggestions to reflect the own organizational reality and adapt to future needs. The benefit was seen mainly in the dialogue between practice and science, between work councils and occupational social partners, the look “outside of the box”, to the diverse and balanced information on exciting and current topics, the opportunity to make new contacts and the possibility to network and learn new talking points. It has also proven the presentation of 12 good practice examples as well as the perfect organization of the event. This has shown a good mix of science, practice and occupational social partners as a model that should be continued in the future. (GRI LA11, GRI SO5) Gender Monitoring All projects are subject to the QFC own gender monitoring. The QFC has appointed a gender officer. Every year the gender officer will prepare a gender report. The report for 2011 is now available. Also projects will be viewed in terms of their gender relevance. In addition, recommendations for the consideration of gender mainstream are given. The report for 2012 is available since September 2013.
