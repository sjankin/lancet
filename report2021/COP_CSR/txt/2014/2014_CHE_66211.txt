We took immediate corrective action and instituted preventive action. Staff were retrained, documented procedures were updated and new spray nozzles were installed in the scrubber. A capital project is currently in process to replace the scrubber heat exchanger. The release triggered an off-site complaint by an industrial neighbor when an employee smelled ammonia.
