DISCUSSION WITH FRANCIS LAMBILLIOTTE, CEO In a continuingly difficult economic climate in 2013, but Results in terms of sales, new order bookings and order one that nevertheless showed encouraging signs of recovery, backlog were higher than in 2012 thanks to new order was the Hamon Group’s performance up to expectations ? bookings that were fairly evenly distributed around the globe. Yes, we are in line with the market trend: the Hamon Group recorded significant new order levels in 2013, a real sign What were the highlights for 2013 for each Business Unit (BU) ? of recovery as much in Europe and the U.S. as in the Far East and the Middle East. New order bookings in 2013 This across-the-board high order intake in 2013 extended reached an all-time high and the order backlog at the end to nearly all of Hamon’s business units. For Cooling of December was just as excellent. In our business, Systems, Hamon received a large order in Poland for we work with a long-term perspective, so this good the construction of the natural draft cooling tower with performance will only impact the figures in the quarters flue gas injection for the Kozienice plant. Another major to come, which means that 2013 may be less exceptional reference for the Group was in China where Hamon than hoped. received orders for air-cooled condensers for two power plants of 2 x 660 MW each – certainly worthy of mention – along with three times two natural draft cooling towers Was the order backlog at the end of 2013 as satisfactory as for which our Group is supplying the internal parts. that in 2012, which came to EUR 621,4 million ? As for the Process Heat Exchangers BU, Hamon booked its first major order for an LNG liquefaction terminal. It was more satisfactory than on 31 December 2012 as, As concerns Air Pollution Control, Hamon won an EDF at the end of 2013, we had an order backlog of nearly order to upgrade several electrostatic precipitators for EUR 750 million ... an all-time high for the Group ! the coal-fired power plants in Le Havre and Cordemais Part 1 General presentation of the Group 9 in France. Orders in this field are on the rise, particularly Hamon strives to follow the ten principles laid down in Poland (Kozienice) and Vietnam. At the end of the by the United Nations on the issues of human rights, year, Hamon signed a contract for one of the biggest working conditions, the environment and corruption. fabric filters in the world for a power plant in Indonesia, We are achieving this through appropriate measures, by in partnership with our Chinese subsidiary.

How will Hamon anticipate Also of note is the ongoing construction of the concrete this turning point in the years to come ? shells for two cooling towers for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, U.S. Renewable energy is now a major sector in Europe and even in some emerging countries. In the West, some traditional power plants have been shut down. Is Asia still the main driver behind Hamon’s growth ? This phenomenon is even more significant in the U.S. where coal-fired plants (50% of its power plants) have While Europe and the U.S. are still major markets for either been shut down or, for the more efficient ones, the upgrade and improvement of existing power plants, modernized. The switch from coal to gas is an opportunity emerging countries will be playing a key role in the Group’s for Hamon, which is developing heat recovery system growth with the construction of a number of new power solutions, particularly with its company Deltak, and its plants and factories. That is why Hamon is continuing cooling systems.

We are currently increasing our teams in Korea and India in order to better cope with the increase in business in In 2012, the Hamon Group’s workforce increased by 16 %. these offices. What about in 2013 ? Due to our continuous business growth in Asia, Increased pressure from our Asian competitors and therefore we increased our workforce both for manufacturing the pressure on margins remain high: how is the Hamon – particularly in China and India – and for our engineering Group responding to this ? and contracting business activities in the rest of Asia. However, in Europe and the U.S., the number of employees We are responding with various approaches and through remained stable. Overall, in 2013, jobs in the Group rose a continuous process. Firstly, by offering products that by 11 % in relation to 2012, thanks to our active presence are new (to stand out from the competition), but also in growth markets. Hamon employs close to 2 000 staff more efficient and more profitable for our customers. worldwide, a figure that does not include the fitters and Secondly, by improving our costs through design-to-cost, builders recruited on sites for short periods. which involves developing a new design at the lowest cost. Lastly, having a worldwide procurement base, bigger volumes and in-depth knowledge of the best suppliers around the world is another way of dealing with this pressure on margins. (*) The UN Global Compact asks companies to embrace, support and enact, within their sphere of influence, a set of core values In 2013, Hamon joined the United Nations Global Compact (*). in the areas of human rights, labor standards, the environment Being a corporate citizen is therefore a key commitment for and anti-corruption.

Responsibility chapter. 10 Hamon Annual Report 2013 At the end of 2012, you seemed fairly optimistic about 2013. What are the prospects for 2014 ? In 2014, we will benefit from the ambitious work undertaken over the last five years, in other words, the development of new products and the move into new regions around the world. We have opened up or further developed new regions such as India, China, the ASEAN countries, Russia, and the Black Sea countries, where we are recording good performance. In 2014 we will reap the rewards of these efforts, with a rising turnover and sufficient volumes to absorb the costs and investments made in recent years. So we are reasonably optimistic about 2014. What will be the main challenges ? Successfully and proactively delivering on our record order backlog, pursuing our international growth while ensuring that we have skilled people in emerging countries, and maintaining our strong position in countries where we already have a firm footing. Another challenge will be developing our network and focusing R&D development on high-potential, value-added products in niche markets. All this should start to bear profit for the Hamon Group between 2014 and 2016; increasing our profitability is still one of our major goals.

This means that the value of projects in USD, As Hamon operates in a number of sectors (coal, gas and when converted into EUR, is slightly lower than it was nuclear), sector changes – and the investments they a year previously due to the drop in the dollar. require – are fairly beneficial to the Group. At geographical level, we can see that the market for new power plant construction has remained strong and on the rise in Asia (particularly in the Middle East and Far East). This market is weaker in Europe and North America; however, the market for the upgrade of existing plants is more significant in these regions and relatively stable. 16 Hamon Annual Report 2013 Students from the University of Liège (Belgium) visiting our Umbergaon factory (India) Corporate Social Responsibility Introduction Since 2010, Hamon has formalized and further positioned As recommended by ISO 26000, Hamon has also its activities regarding sustainable development.

The chapter “Corporate Social Responsibility” in this report details our commitments in this area. Our suppliers enhance our added value chain. Over time, we are building preferred relationships with some of these suppliers. We want to ensure a global sourcing for the whole Group. This strategy enables us to develop stable relationships with our suppliers around the world, by providing guaranteed quality at a competitive price. On an annual basis, we audit several suppliers. This is not just an audit in the strictest sense of the word; it is also the opportunity to exchange points of view and to have in-depth and constructive dialogues with these suppliers. Lastly, the financial community helps us to achieve our development: ■ Banks for our financial needs (bank loans and guarantees, and other commercial banking tools). ■ Financial analysts who measure our performance. Several times per year, we organize analyst meetings to give them an overview of the Group’s evolution and to enable them to interact with us directly. ■ Financial markets. Hamon is aware that the contribution of each stakeholder adds to its success and performance. Establishing a permanent dialog in order to improve our understanding of their expectations is the first step towards corporate social responsibility. For this reason, we welcome comments, aspirations and other views from all our stakeholders. ■ Our staff can raise their comments with the personnel department, with the enterprise committees (for the Part 1 General presentation of the Group 39 Part of the Cooling Systems BU sales team at the VGB exhibition 40 Hamon Annual Report 2013 View of the new plant producing internal components for cooling towers in China Review of the year 2013 Summary ■ Sales growth + 11 % compared to 2012 but still below our expectations.

Hamon has just identified the key stakeholders which seem the most important as groups. Nevertheless, the prioritization of the material aspects (in terms of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility) will be conducted early 2014. This will be done with panels including some staff members and some suppliers, as well as with a few customers. This will be conducted in the frame of the adoption of the GRI’s G4 sustainability reporting guidelines; the G4 guidelines will be used for the 2014 annual report. For section S 07: there has been no legal action against Hamon for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust or monopoly practices in 2013.
