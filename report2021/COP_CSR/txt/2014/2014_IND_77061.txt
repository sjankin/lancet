This scheme targets differently abled people, homemakers & other economically marginalised groups. Over 1800 Knowledge Associates have benefitted from the programme over the last 10 years.

Eco-friendly Awareness Campaign Environmental awareness & sustainability play a major role in the formation of the UN Global Compact’s principles.

The goal was to educate everyone on the issue & inspire them to use Eco-friendly Substitutes for plastic. The campaign focuses on the use of the following: Use of glass bottles instead of plastic Reusable bags made of paper of jute Energy saving devices & low-energy using gadgets Fuel saving techniques including car pooling practices Additionally, Datamatics engages in several practices that ensure our carbon footprint is as low as possible. Use of paper is lowered to the bare minimum & green housekeeping practices are followed. The housekeeping staffs are trained in waste management to make better use of refuse & leave a greener world for all. Marketing Events Go Paper-Less At Datamatics we have started a practice to introduce an entire conference/event through the content that is accessed by scanning QR codes instead of providing pounds of paper collateral to attendees. This has also helped us to demonstrate & show our clients how to really exploit mobile marketing, & at the same time be eco-friendly by not handing out all that paper that would mostly be heading for the landfill.
