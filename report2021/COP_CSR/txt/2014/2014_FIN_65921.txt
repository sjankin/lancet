Additionally, we will continue our program internal research work and the implementation of measures to improve the efficiency of energy use, including the compiling of a global database for actions to improve energy efficiency. The most significant savings targets identified are related to the use fuel, e.g. natural gas, and heat. Potential savings were also found outside the production process, e.g. in cooling, compressed air systems and building services. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ENERGY PROGRAM 2013 During 2013, more than 30 different energy-efficiency projects started or implemented in Metso's own production generated a total savings of 2,100 tons of carbon dioxide. Additionally, a number of smaller initiatives and actions have taken place globally in our production units. We have implemented 170 projects that have led to carbon dioxide savings of 12,300 tons since 2009 when Metso’s energy-efficiency program was started. Since then, investments totaling EUR 4.1 million have resulted in savings of 45,700 MWh of energy, worth EUR 3.1 million; these investments have a payback time ranging from one to three years. To speed up the energy and CO2 savings in our production, we have a separate budget for energy and CO2 investments. Metso uses both intensity (e.g. MWh/ton) and absolute targets (MWh/a) in its energy and CO2 emissions reductions program. An absolute target is used for specific sites, while the rest of Metso's We strive to reduce the environmental footprint of our own production sites are using an intensity target.
