Sustainability Report 2013 SEKEM Sustainability Report 2013 Dear Readers, the difficult last years are showing how deeply rooted the challenges within the Egyptian society are. There are no quick solutions but the need for long-term transformation processes. Under the ongoing economic stress SEKEM had to take consequences and reduce its investments into reclaiming new desert land for our Organic agricultural production. On the other side SEKEM has proofed its resilience through its holistic model of sustainable development and its learning community, including all our farmers, physicians, teachers, suppliers, managers, partners, investors, friends, employees and students. Moreover, SEKEM companies were able to keep their sales stable and continued investing into the community. The SEKEM Development Foundation was fully running its cultural and societal activities and the Heliopolis University for Sustainable Development increased the total number of students to 356 in its three faculties. With this unique institutional ecosystem we have the opportunity to create the technological and social innovations needed to address Egypt’s multiple challenges during this difficult time. To invest into the agricultural and industrial development, SEKEM has contracted a local investment bank to raise equity, hence we are very confident to find the right partners within 2014. I would like to use the opportunity to thank you for your loyalty and trust in SEKEM and all your support through these years.
