It is also a driver of innovation. Numerous breakthroughs we’ve brought to the market—from the zero-emission Nissan LEAF to our cutting-edge Safety Shield technologies—have been inspired by our vision of a better world. As we develop the cars of the future, we’re working to create products that not only strengthen our business but also enhance our society, increase mobility and help to solve today’s most significant safety and environmental challenges. For more than a century, cars have helped to drive economies and provided freedom of mobility to billions. But this progress has come at a cost. Every day, more than 3,000 people die in auto-related accidents. Many are due to human error. In the United States, for example, it’s the cause of 93% of accidents. In addition, traffic congestion and long commutes result in hours of lost productivity—and exacerbate carbon-output problems. The world’s CO2 emissions have grown to exceed 30 billion tons annually. Transport generates at least 20% of these emissions. As one of the world’s leading car makers, Nissan has a responsibility to ensure that the automobile remains a vehicle for global progress and prosperity. This means we must reduce and help to eliminate the negative consequences of car use while bolstering the benefits of clean, efficient Carlos Ghosn transportation. We have launched a variety of initiatives to meet these President and Chief Executive Officer goals—and to ensure that our business operations conserve water and air Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. resources, minimize CO2 output and utilize renewable energies. One of the most exciting steps we are taking to transform the use and impact of automobiles is our work to deliver Nissan’s Autonomous Drive technology to the marketplace.

As Nissan LEAF runs on a lithium-ion battery and electric motor, and it emits energy storage devices, they can play a key role in supporting the rollout no CO2 or other exhaust emissions during operation. The EV offers of renewable energy with intermittent output, such as solar and wind excellent, fun-to-drive performance, with smooth, strong acceleration and power. By contributing to the shift to renewable energy, EVs play an quiet delivery across a speed range comparable to that of other models, essential role beyond transportation to achieve a low-carbon society. as well as great handling stability realized by well-balanced weight distribution. All of this has earned Nissan LEAF high marks from drivers since its debut in 2010. Nissan LEAF is now sold in 35 countries on four continents, with sales increasing every year.

Specifically, the annual CO2 emissions resulting from each employee’s commute is calculated using a standard unit of measurement announced by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Ministry of the Environment, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. This figure is calculated on the basis that employees working at Global Headquarters commute by bus and others employees use cars that are vehicles designated by Nissan, based on the data they submit when applying for transportation allowances.

The average CO2 emissions for the use phase (including direct emissions only) per unit are calculated for each of our main regions (Japan, North America, EU and China) and extrapolated from average emissions of these markets for other markets.

It also displays Nissan’s corporate responsibility toward and solutions for other environmental measures, which it undertakes through a range of programs not environmental issues, its dedication to electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous limited to EVs. The company also displays earnest efforts in the areas of safety and driving, its calls for CO2 reduction by 2050, and much more. All of this is rooted in the quality, which are closely related to the environment. When it comes to the long-term perspective held by the company’s top management, based on which a environment, the E component of ESG investment, Japanese companies are well variety of efforts are underway. Furthermore, Nissan deserves high marks for carrying regarded internationally, and Nissan can be expected to remain a front-runner in the out materiality assessment at the top level of the company and describing the future as well. Nissan also deserves recognition for touching on “sales and service processes involved in this Sustainability Report. quality” in this report. Nissan’s eight sustainability strategies underpin the value of the Nissan’s approach to philanthropy with focus on the three areas of Toshihiko Goto company’s intangible assets. By enhancing the strategies, Nissan can also environment, education and humanitarian support is to be commended, but enhance its corporate values. All of them are important, and it is appropriate to today the global debate has shifted to the post-2015 landscape. In the future, Chief Executive Sustainability Forum Japan disclose information on them to a multi-stakeholder audience. The world’s Nissan will need to distill its focus still more, engaging in strategic philanthropy investors, however, are guided to a significant extent by the principles of and tying those efforts to business opportunities. One key concept for the so-called ESG investment, where choices are made according to a company’s company to keep in mind as it does this will be engagement with a full range of environmental, social and governance stances. Of these three, I would note that stakeholders. governance is particularly important to ESG investors. In February 2014 Japan’s In the area of employee issues, Nissan is a diversity top-runner in Japan, Financial Services Agency issued the “Japanese Stewardship Code,” a set of earning society’s respect for its efforts in the two areas of gender and cultural principles to be followed by responsible institutional investors. This signals the diversity. However, in April 2013 the European Commission proposed an onset of an era when ESG and long-term approaches to investment will be the amendment to accounting legislation that would require companies to form mainstream in Japan, too. Nissan is clearly placing emphasis on different issues policy and report on the diversity of their boards of directors. In April 2014, the and undertaking information disclosure in different ways according to the European Parliament adopted this as a new directive. It takes time for a stakeholders involved, as can be seen from the company’s use of its CSR company to foster human resources and reform its corporate culture, so one scorecard and other activities. We can expect to see Nissan continue earning high thing Nissan needs now is to consider a policy, with the years up to around marks in terms of socially responsible investment (SRI) rankings and ratings. 2050 in its scope, that addresses diversity not just at the executive level but for Nissan has made efforts over time to enhance its Alliance with Renault, all employees. taking this relationship to an even higher stage. As the companies’ supply-chain In the post-industrial-capitalism age of the 21st century, people’s wisdom management and purchasing functions are increasingly converging, we can will be the primary player in companies’ activities. The creation of peopleexpect to see enhanced efforts along similar lines throughout the value chain— centered organizations will be the most important task underlying all areas of in particular in terms of the implementation and improvement of due diligence. corporate endeavor. While I feel this is something that Nissan recognizes and is Supply chains in the automotive industry are broad and deep, making it difficult already moving to address, it bears repeating here. to carry out due diligence even for tier-1 suppliers—much less those at tier 2 Finally, I would note that while the Sustainability Report is to be and later stages in the chains. Nevertheless, due diligence is a vitally important commended for its inclusion of a broad range of data, demands are on the rise aspect of CSR in the emerging and developing markets that will be the main for more reporting of CSR information that focuses on long-term policies and field for business competition in the future, as well as a key topic to address in targets and such information presented with financial details in integrated gauging the risks and opportunities of a globalizing economy. In this connection, reporting. Nissan needs to channel its reporting efforts in this direction, too. the skillful use of information and communications technology throughout the value chain will be a major issue to address from now on.
