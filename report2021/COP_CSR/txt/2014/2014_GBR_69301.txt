® Rotork plc United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2013 STATEMENT OF CONTINED SUPPORT Our company has been signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003 and we continue to support it and strive to embed its principles into the everyday operations of our business. Since 2003, we have made many measurable improvements in our corporate social responsibility performance. We have developed a CSR structure including a CSR committee chaired by the Chief Executive with sub-committees covering ethics, the environment, health and safety and social issues. In 2013, our CSR performance improvements included rolling out comprehensive online anti-bribery and corruption training, exceeding the group accident frequency rate and carbon emissions targets and continuing to support WaterAid as Rotork’s global charity as well as charitable causes local to Rotork’s locations. Full details of our progress in 2013 can be found in our 2013 Annual Report. We continue to be a constituent member of the FTSE4Good index. As a global business manufacturing control products used in a wide range of industries including water, power and oil and gas, we recognise that we have the opportunity to positively impact the lives of a significant number of individuals and businesses globally through the products we manufacture and the services we provide and it is our intention that by adopting the Global Compact principles our positive impact will continue to improve. Full details of our support for the UN Global Compact, progress and future targets can be found in the Rotork plc Annual Report 2013 which can be downloaded from our website.
