I summarize the improvements and progress we have made by each principle where applicable. Signature Name and Position Chris Lee, CEO PRINCIPLE 1 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS Since attaining SA8000 Social Accountability System in 2009 the system has undergone eight independent audits and there were no reported non-compliances. Our certification number is GB09/79253. This year Brand Addition was awarded the gold level Code of Conduct by the European Promotional Products Association. PRINCIPLE 2 BUSINESS SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES Whilst both our European and Far East Factory Audit program are well established we are now working closely with our partner in Turkey to ensure that factories and suppliers we are using in this territory do not contravene the principles of the ETI, ILO and SA8000. The Brand Addition Code of Practice highlighting these principles continues to be issued to all suppliers on an annual basis. PRINCIPLE 3 BUSINESS SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THEEFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING Brand Addition operates an Employee Forum which compromises of a cross section of employees from across Manchester and London. This forum will be extended to the team in Ireland in 2014 now that they have had time to settle into Brand Addition. This Forum forms the basis of our Information and Consultation Committee. All staff, during induction are notified of their rights with regard to freedom of association. PRINCIPLE 4 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY LABOUR Brand Addition has been re-accredited the Investors in People status for the UK Operations in Manchester and London. Our focus for 2014 is Health & Well Being and we will be holding a number of workshops, exercise classes and individual health assessments with professionally trained external contacts for employees. We will also look to extend our accreditation to include Ireland at our next formal assessment in 2015, This standard provides a simple and flexible framework that is versatile, flexible, non-prescriptive, outcome based and recognises that every organisation is different and therefore needs to reach their end goals in their own way PRINCIPLE 5 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR Within our supply chain we continue to audit factories in the Far East using SA8000 as a guide to ensure compliance is met. This is actively encouraged and reiterated during the European vendor audit programme through our tier 2 supply chain. This is an ongoing process and Corrective Action Plans are monitored. PRINCIPLE 6 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION Brand Addition is committed to promoting diversity and equal opportunities in employment. We will not support any form or unlawful or unfair discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, religion and/or belief, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, HIV status, marital or family status, disability or age. Brand Addition develops and implements procedures and practices that provide equality of opportunity for both current employees and those applying for positions within the company. Brand Addition believes that its future success is dependent upon its workforce reflecting the composition, talents and skills of the community in which it operates. Diversity and equality of opportunity within the company are consistently reflected in our decisions relating to the recruitment, selection, training, promotion, transfers, benefits and terms and conditions of our employees. All decisions will be made on the basis of objective and job related criteria. PRINCIPLE 7 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES Brand Addition continues to keep abreast of environmental legislation be it relating to new or revised rules. Brand Addition has now signed up with the Environmental Legislation Update Service. Transport and in particular use of company cars on business have been added to our environmental aspects for the purpose of encouraging more business meetings via conferencing services or travel on public transport. PRINCIPLE 8 BUSINESS SHOULD UNDERTAKE INITIATIVE TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY The offices at Brand Addition are to receive a major makeover this year and key to the selection of the contractor will be their ability to recycle waste materials. Additionally, during the makeover the air-conditioning units will be replaced with units containing an inert refrigerant gas PRINCIPLE 9 BUSINESS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES. During 2013 the filament bulb lighting system in the warehouse and external lighting was replaced with energy efficient LED lighting. This achieved a 60% reduction of energy in these areas.
