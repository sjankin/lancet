Strategy Strategy and analysis 1.1 The year 2013 was again a difficult one for the Italian economy, with substantial negative impacts STATEMENT OF THE on the domestic banking sector both in terms of the volumes of business and the operating results CHAIRMEN of banks. In this context, UBI Banca nevertheless succeeded in achieving good results (reported in the consolidated financial report) both in terms of compliance with regulatory requirements – capital and liquidity levels – and in terms of profits, still small but appreciable in such difficult times. The results achieved by UBI Banca are the fruit of strategic choices, which originate at all levels from belief in the strong ethical values and principles expressed in the Group’s Code of Ethics and in the universal principles of the UN Global Compact, in which we renew our commitment. They are results achieved in all respects in a context of social responsibility and sustainability, the first component of which is economic in nature: to always pursue a sound operational balance by matching assets to liabilities and constantly adjusting structural costs to the levels of business allowed by market conditions, as an indispensable condition for creating value for registered shareholders and all stakeholders in the medium to long-term. In this respect and in relation to market conditions, we feel that it is important that we were able again this year to declare a dividend at the Shareholders’ Meeting, slightly larger than in 2013 although still small, and that we were able to again allocate significant profits to funds for social purposes in accordance with the Articles of Association of UBI Banca and the various network banks of the Group. In social terms, being sustainable means making a constant commitment to achieve our operating and financial objectives in observance of our institutional mission to serve families and local economies with business activity which is able to grasp the opportunities arising from the development of social dynamics and at the same time to pay careful attention to situations of fragility and difficulty and to important social causes and concerns. It also means maintaining intense activity to support the very many social and welfare, cultural, sports and recreational initiatives of the communities in which we live and operate in line with our mutual spirit as a cooperative. In this sense, results such as strong growth in the grant of home purchase mortgages, the high levels of customer satisfaction measured by the Consultation Project surveys, the success of UBI Community and the placement of social bonds, the prizes received and in particular the National Prize for Innovation awarded by the President of the Republic for socially useful innovation in banking services, the size of the social donations made in a still difficult year – over €12.5 million – are important to us, a sign of an active and profitable presence in communities. The third component of sustainability for the bank, environmental commitment, meant not only reducing consumption and emissions in carrying out our activities, but also and above all consideration of the contributions that it can make to initiatives and investments to protect the environment and to reduce the environmental impacts of customers and suppliers. From this viewpoint strong attention to costs affected internal choices, which were directed towards optimising the cost-benefit ratios of possible initiatives, while nevertheless maintaining the high standards already achieved – such as the exclusive use of electricity from renewable sources – and continuing to reduce consumption and emissions. However, it was above all the difficult market environment which penalised investments by households and businesses in the environment, causing a significant reduction in new loans granted, only partially offset by project finance operations. The long period of recession should finally come to an end in 2014, but with very low economic growth. Furthermore, for banks it will be the year of the “Asset Quality Review” and of the “Stress 1 Social Report 2013 Strategy and analysis Tests” as part of the changeover from national to European supervision and “popular” banks – the larger listed banks in particular – must also look carefully at their governance models in relation to Bank of Italy and market recommendations which are becoming increasingly more pressing. There is therefore reason for some optimism, but also for great concern and responsibility which we have taken on board and which lie at the basis of our strategic priorities for the near future: high quality products and services to take full advantage of market opportunities; capital strength to adequately support growth in business; appropriate governance systems to reconcile and effectively combine demands from the market, from the shareholder base, from customers, from staff and from all stakeholders. On the basis of these priorities, we commenced the new year with an important project to evolve our “popular” bank model, which we do not intend to give up because we firmly believe in the validity of the values and principles of “popular” co-operative lending. We have therefore submitted a series of amendments to the Articles of Association to an Extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders designed to combine demands for economy and efficiency, appropriate to a listed company with a broad institutional shareholder base, with the principles of democratic mutualism, a historic trait of co-operatives. We feel that this is an essential step to take in order to continue to “Fare Banca per bene” (to be a good bank), profitably combining the inescapable demands for profitability with the social responsibility that characterises our activity, in order to make the true sense of our solid presence in communities increasingly more recognisable in the creation of shared value. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board The Chairman of the Management Board Andrea Moltrasio Franco Polotti 2 Social Report 2013 Strategy and analysis 1.2 UBI Banca’s Code of Ethics identifies the significant stakeholders of the Group, which are those KEY IMPACTS, RISKS “groups and individuals who are holders of specific interests on which UBI’s activities have effects AND OPPORTUNITIES and/or which contribute in various ways to UBI’s activity and its very existence.” Important issues and the relative risks and opportunities within the different areas of sustainability are considered for each category of stakeholder, account of which is taken in formulating policies and setting operating objectives. The evolving context and the performance of operations relating to social responsibility and sustainability strategies and objectives are monitored over time as part of the following: strategic planning processes; consultation and dialogue activities (e.g. customer satisfaction surveys); analysis of agency ratings and analysts and CSR investors’ opinions; and also monitoring of indicators calculated as part of the CSR reporting process in the Social Report. In the particularly difficult current economic environment, it is essential to give priority to financial and operating figures with a particular focus on levels of liquidity and capital and controlling costs. In relation to this commitment, the lines of action identified in the 2011-2013/15 Business Plan, summarised in the table below, have been confirmed. They relate in particular to the prevention of reputational risk, which is particularly in evidence in the financial sector, and to grasping opportunities arising from the emergence of new concerns and demands of a social and environmental nature. Some objectives have been affected, and in the near future will probably continue to be affected by the availability of financial resources, which means that careful planning must be carried out with priority given to initiatives with the best cost/benefit ratios.

Furthermore, employees who are also registered shareholders may attend meetings with the right to speak and vote, on a par with other registered shareholders, with the sole limitation that they may not act as proxies. 4.5 Members of the governing bodies of the Group do not receive any variable remuneration, except for LINKAGE BETWEEN Board Members and CEOs who may receive forms of remuneration linked to results. The Chief MANAGEMENT Executive Officer and Members of the Management Board or senior managers of UBI Banca may COMPENSATION AND receive forms of remuneration linked to results because they are classified as “key personnel”. PERFORMANCE 4.6 The Bank pays particular attention to transactions with related parties to ensure they are carried CONFLICTS OF out properly both in form and substance. Transactions with senior officers of the bank, with senior INTEREST officers of Group member companies and with companies controlled by them – all of whom may qualify as related parties – are conducted under normal market conditions and, for those transactions relating to senior officers of banks, the provisions of Article 136 of Legislative Decree No. 385/1993 (Consolidated Banking Act) are carefully complied with. Special IT procedures have been introduced in this respect which, on the basis of declarations issued by representatives of 23 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement companies, make it possible to identify in advance the potential assumption of a direct or indirect obligation of a representative and consequently subject the transaction to the procedures required by the aforementioned article. The Consob (Italian securities market authority) has approved Regulations, which lay down the procedures to follow for the approval of transactions entered into by listed companies and issuers with a broad shareholder base with parties that could create a conflict of interest. Such parties include major and controlling shareholders, members of management and supervisory bodies and other senior managers and their immediate family members. The regulations in question apply, within the context of the UBI Banca Group, to UBI Banca as an issuer of listed shares. As a result of the foregoing, the competent bodies of the Bank have approved a set of regulations concerning related-party transactions (available on corporate website of the Parent) within the set time limits. Internal processes have also been developed to assure compliance with the new rules. The Bank of Italy has issued new provisions regarding supervisory regulations for risk assets and conflicts of interest concerning parties connected to banks or banking groups. (including, amongst others, senior officers of UBI Banca and all the banks in the Group, the officers of UBI Leasing and parties connected to those officers according to the definition given in the regulations). The main purpose of the regulations is to contain the risk that the closeness of some “connected parties” to the decision-making centres of the Bank might compromise the objectivity and impartiality of decisions concerning the grant of loans to, or other transactions that in any way relate to, those parties. To oversee these risks, the UBI Group, in compliance with Bank of Italy provisions: • monitors and ensures compliance with the specific prudential limits set by the supervisory regulations concerning risk asset exposures to connected parties by the Parent and Subsidiaries. In this regard a specific “Policy concerning internal controls on risk assets and conflicts of interest with related parties” has been approved, according to the procedures set out in the Bank of Italy provisions referred to above; • employs special decision-making procedures that guarantee the integrity of decisionmaking processes in connected-party transactions, preventing any abuses that may be intrinsic to transactions with these parties where there is a potential conflict of interest. These procedures have been implemented by special regulations, applicable to all the Group member companies and available on the corporate website of the Parent. Generally, in a similar manner to the provisions laid down for the Management Board by Art. 2391 of the Italian Civil Code, the Articles of Association also require the members of the Supervisory Board to report all interests which, either directly or through third parties, they may have in a determined transaction of the company to which they belong or of the Group, stating the nature, the terms, origin and extent. The relative resolution of the Supervisory Board must give adequate reasons, explaining the interest of the Bank in the transaction, without prejudice to other provisions of the law or regulations which may apply. In relation to the legislation in force which implements the EC MiFID Directive No. 2004/39/EC, an internal “policy for the management of personal transactions” has been approved which provides detailed regulation of obligations concerning personal transactions in financial instruments performed by significant parties, as identified in the above-mentioned legislation. 4.7 The requirements which Board Members must possess to form part of the management bodies of QUALIFICATIONS OF UBI Banca are reported below. The curricula vitae of the members of the Supervisory Board, the THE Management Board and the General Management of the Parent are available on the website of the ADMINISTRATORS Parent. http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Supervisory-Board-EN.aspx, http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Management-Board-EN.aspx Supervisory Board The members of the Supervisory Board must be in possession of the requirements of integrity and 24 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement independence prescribed by the regulations in force. At least 15 of the Members of the Supervisory Board must be in possession of the requirements of professionalism required by the legislation currently in force for persons who perform the functions of directors of banks. In particular, at least three members of the Supervisory Board must be chosen from amongst persons enrolled in the Registro dei Revisori Contabili (register of external statutory auditors) who have practiced as external statutory auditors for a period of not less than three years. While mandatory regulations of the law, the Supervisory Authority or other regulations must be complied with, persons already holding the office of full statutory auditor, or who are members of other supervisory bodies in more than five listed companies and/or their parent companies or subsidiaries, cannot hold office as a member of the Supervisory Board. If the cause of incompatibility is not eliminated within 60 days of election or, if it arose subsequently, of notification of the occurrence to the person concerned, the Board Member will automatically be dismissed from office. In view of the coming appointment of a new Supervisory Board and Management Board, a document was prepared in the first months of 2013 on what was considered best the qualitative and quantitative composition of the two bodies. The results of this analysis were disclosed to the public and distributed to Registered Shareholders. Following the appointment of a new Supervisory Board by the Shareholders’ Meeting, as part of the process of verifying the requirements of integrity, professionalism and independence under the regulations in force, in May that Board proceeded to verify whether the qualitative and quantitative composition identified in that document corresponded to the actual composition resulting from the election process. After detailed analysis of the professional competencies of the various members of the body, the Supervisory Board assessed and ascertained the consistency of its composition with the qualitative and quantitative composition considered optimal in relation to the achievement of the objective of correctly fulfilling its functions. Management Board At least one member of the Management Board must hold the requirements of independence th pursuant to Art. 148, paragraph three of Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998. Furthermore, at least the majority of the members must have a total of at least three years experience in professional and/or management activities in financial and/or brokerage and/or banking and/or insurance companies in Italy or abroad. The provisions of the Internal regulations on the limits to the accumulation of positions by company staff , adopted by the Parent and implemented by Group banks, apply to the Management Board. Succession Planning In order to guarantee continuity and certainty in the management of the Bank, back in 2011 UBI Banca put a senior leadership succession process in place designed to select and assess managers from within the Group for consideration as possible candidates to succeed to senior executive positions and to those of Chief Executive Officer and General Manager in particular. The “senior leadership succession” is a periodic process to assess the managerial skills and potential of each of the managers who fill high ranking roles in the Group. Reports and Accounts 2013 p. 27**-28** 4.8 For UBI Banca “Fare Banca Per Bene” means creating a vision of a bank in which you can trust, a MISSION, VALUES, bank recognised on the market for its way of management based on a constant sense of ethics, CODES OF CONDUCT transparency and integrity in business. It means believing in strong and shared values and putting AND PRINCIPLES them into practice in observance of principles and rules of conduct which are not seen as G4G4-57 limitations, but as the way to establish our identity on the market. The Group’s mission, values and ADVICE ON ETHICAL principles are formally set out in its Charter of Values and Code of Ethics, which are based, amongst AND LAWFUL 25 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement BEHAVIOUR other things, on the principles of the Global Compact. G4– G4–58 Our Charter of Values, approved in January 2008, identifies the mission, vision and values on which REPORTS OF the Group has based its identity and the conduct of all personnel in their relationships with UNETHICAL OR customers and with all other stakeholders as much in its strategic choices as in its everyday UNLAWFUL business. BEHAVIOUR The Code of Ethics was approved at the end of 2010 by the Management Board and by the Supervisory Board of UBI Banca. It was officially adopted by the banks and companies in the Group when it was approved by their respective governing bodies and it was distributed to other equity investees of the Bank who have agreed to maintain conduct consistent with the principles contained in it. It has been communicated to personnel through the consultation of internal regulations on the corporate intranet and in hardcopy form for companies who have no access to that portal and it is also published on the Group website. A copy of the Code is delivered to members of corporate bodies, to newly recruited personnel and to all those who do business with the Group under contract or who represent the Bank without being subordinate to it, when a relationship is established. Major suppliers are required to sign a declaration of acceptance as part of the respective contract documents. The Group CSR Manager provides support and advice for training and communication activities and for the interpretation and implementation of the principles of the Code of Ethics. Any reports of problems concerning unethical or unlawful behaviour and questions relating to corporate integrity are regulated by the Code of Ethics. The Chief Audit Executive (chief of audit at the Parent and for the Group) is responsible for receiving reports (which may also be received at a dedicated email address codice.etico@ubibanca.it) and for carrying out the relative inspections: the Internal Audit Function records reports received, carries out an initial assessment to determine the importance and then forwards them to bodies with management and control functions and: • to the Supervisory Body, if the alleged violation is significant for the purposes of regulations pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01; • to the organisational unit that manages relations with the stakeholder who has committed the alleged violation, or the relative body in question, in other cases. While reports cannot be kept anonymous under the Code, they are kept strictly confidential and those making reports are protected against any form of retaliation, discrimination or penalty. Four reports of alleged violations of the Code of Ethics were received in 2013 (three from customers and suppliers and one from personnel). Having carried out appropriate inspections, the Chief Audit Executive found no reports of very serious violation of the Code of Ethics. The Code of Conduct approved at the end of 2011 by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of UBI Banca is based on the principles of the Code of Ethics and is aimed at all those in a working relationship with UBI Banca. It is designed to furnish a framework of principles of conduct with which to evaluate compliance of decisions to be taken with ethical and regulatory norms. Banks and companies belonging to the Group have also adopted the same text, modified, where appropriate, with the consent of the Parent, to meet requirements dictated by specific sectors and/or areas of activity. Failure to observe the rules of the Code of Conduct constitutes violation of the Code of Ethics: instances of non-compliance must be reported and are punished in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Code of Ethics and in compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to the employment contract in question. 4.9 The following specialist roles have been created, filled mainly by middle managers, in order to PROCEDURES FOR manage social and environmental responsibility issues with the aim of supporting and pursuing high THE IDENTIFICATION standards of quality in different areas and in compliance with the provisions of national legislation: AND MANAGEMENT • the Corpo Corporate (CSR)) Manager co-ordinates issues of an ethical, social rate Social Responsibility (CSR OF ECONOMIC, and environmental nature in operations, consistent with a strategic corporate vision and ENVIRONMENTAL in implementation of the Group social responsibility model. model The role reports directly to the AND SOCIAL PERFORMANCE Chief Financial Officer, who in turn is on the staff of the Chief Executive Officer; • the Mobility manager is responsible for optimising systematic travel by employees, 26 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement G4-35 G4adopting, amongst other things, tools such as the home-work travel plan (HWTP) [ DELEGATING EN18]; PROCESS • the Health and Safety Manager manages all aspects relating to the health and safety of G4-36 workers, undertaking occupational risk assessment, prevention and monitoring action and DELEGATING the relative corrective and training action [ LA6]; PROCESS FOR SENIOR • the Welfare Manager is responsible for formulating and co-ordinating action to improve MANAGERS the quality of life of persons inside and outside the Bank, from the viewpoint of both organisational well-being and personal well-being, offering concrete opportunities in terms of services and benefits [ LA3]; • the Energy manager is responsible for analysing the energy requirement and for taking action to optimise consumption and improve the energy efficiency of buildings and services [ EN3].

EVALUATING THE Therefore, because functional and effective assessment of the functioning of the boards and HIGHEST committees and of their size and composition can be carried out after an appropriate period of GOVERNANCE activity, a self-assessment process was commenced for both bodies in December 2013 for the years BODY’S OWN 2013, 2014 and 2015 – with indication of the action to be taken and the relative time periods – and PERFORMANCE a “peer review” system and process was formulated and put in place for 2014 and 2015. Reports and Accounts 2013 p. 22**, 37**, 38** G4-52 G4On the basis of a proposal from the Remuneration Committee, which ensures the involvement of PROCESS FOR the competent corporate functions, each year the Supervisory Board of UBI Banca adopts and DETERMINING reviews Group Remuneration and Incentive Policies, Policies within its remit, and submits Remuneration REMUNERATION Policies for the Management Board and that part of the medium to long term incentive plan based Reports and on financial instruments to a Shareholders’ Meeting for approval [ G4-53]. Accounts 2013 The Remuneration Committee makes use of outside advisors in its advisory and supervisory p. 78**-79** 27 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement activities and carries out benchmarking activity with respect to the external wage market. The remuneration policies and practices pursued are subject to examination by the Compliance, Risk Management and Audit Functions, Functions each according to its specific competencies in order to ensure that the remuneration policies and practices pursued comply with the relevant legislation and regulations and that they function properly. UBI Banca subsidiaries submit Remuneration and Incentive Policies set by the Parent to the competent bodies for approval. If that approval takes place before the UBI Banca Annual General Meeting, limited to the part relating to incentives based on financial instruments, that approval is subordinate to approval of that plan by the aforementioned UBI Banca Shareholders’ Meeting. Except for matters that fall within the remit of the Shareholders’ Meeting, any exceptions to Policies are submitted to the Remuneration Committee for an opinion and consequent decisions. Remuneration and incentives policies Remuneration and incentives policies set a ratio to balance the fixed and variable portions of remuneration and establish maximum thresholds. The variable component is designed to involve and guide staff to pursue corporate and Group policies in the medium and long-term. In compliance with EU and national legislation and also with international recommendations, the guidelines on which incentive schemes are based are as follows: • variable remuneration linked to long-term performance measurement indicators which reflect the profitability of the bank over time and are appropriately adjusted for current and future risks, for the cost of equity and the liquidity required to perform the activities undertaken; • consistency with respect to the results actually achieved, with significant reductions and even no bonus payment if performance is below forecasts or negative (a “malus” approach); • assessment of the results of the business unit, of the bank or company a person belongs to and of the Group as a whole and also of the results of the individual; • the use also of indicators that are not economic and financial (e.g. customer satisfaction [ PR5]), which can determine the sustainability of results over the medium to long-term; • the total amount of variable remuneration, which must be such that it does not limit the Bank's ability to maintain an adequate level of capitalisation for the risks assumed; • in compliance with Bank of Italy provisions, mechanisms to defer bonuses and payments in shares exist and a claw-back clause can be triggered in the event of fraudulent behaviour or gross negligence; • special treatments such as guaranteed bonuses and leaving bonuses which exceed those provided for by collective labour agreements are excluded. For personnel belonging to corporate control functions, the incentive scheme is based on parameters relating to the position occupied and the risks managed and it is paid according to the same conditions for payment set for other personnel. In accordance with the legislation, in 2013 UBI Banca updated its Group Remuneration And Incentives Policies, verifying that they were appropriate to long-term strategies and objectives and that the linkage with results was set in relation to the risks and capital and liquidity levels needed to carry out the activities undertaken. At the same time it updated the perimeter of those personnel identified as “Top Management” and the “Highest management level of the control functions”, through a careful process of self-assessment. The most prudent criteria have been applied for those personnel, with at least 50% of the variable component of remuneration consisting of shares with an adequate retention period and at least 40% of remuneration subject to deferred payment systems and retrospective adjustment mechanisms. All staff involved in incentive schemes receive information that is as broad, complete and transparent as possible by means of various tools such as regulations, circulars and information given over the corporate intranet. 28 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement G4-53 G4The procedure for the approval of remuneration and incentive policies [ G4-52] ensures the STAKEHOLDERS AND participation of shareholders in the relative decision-making. More specifically, the Supervisory REMUNERATION Board submits Remuneration and Incentive Policies for the Management Board and for the part of the medium to long-term incentive plan based on financial instruments to a Shareholders’ Meeting for approval. These resolutions relating to the previous year were passed with a very large majority in favour. The remuneration of members of the Supervisory board is set by a shareholders’ meeting. G4G4-54 The individual with the highest remuneration in the Group received €1,497,539 , while the median REMUNERATION for all employees – excluding the individual with the highest remuneration – was €47,212. The ratio RATIO between the two amounts is 32:1. The individual with the highest remuneration in the Group G4-55 G4received no increase compared with the previous year, while the median percentage increase for all REMUNERATION employees – excluding the highest paid individual – was 2.45%. These calculations include both full INCREASE RATIO and part-time employees and both fixed and variable remuneration was considered inclusive of the incentive schemes, one-off bonuses, company bonuses, commercial contests and non-monetary benefits Commitments to external initiatives 4.11 UBI Banca has adopted an internal control system which, in compliance with the principles of the MODALITY OF Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies, with instructions issued by the supervisory APPLICATION OF THE PRECAUTIONARY authority and with the Articles of Association of the Bank, assigns functions and responsibilities to APPROACH the various officers on three levels (managers of organisational units of processes, risk control specialist functions and the Internal Audit function), while it is overseen strategically by the Supervisory Board. The guiding principles of the internal control system are efficiency, efficiency without overlap or gaps in control mechanisms, the consistency of the organisational process, ensuring that adequate responses are made to risks which might hinder the achievement of objectives and conformity conformity with legislation and regulations. Second level control managers – controls assigned to specialist functions including Risk Management, Compliance, Anti-Money Laundering, the Senior Officer Responsible for Accounts and Management Control – are responsible for identifying, preventing and measuring the occurrence of risk situations on a continuous basis and contributing to the formulation of adequate risk-taking and management policies. The Supervisory Board, Management Board and Senior Management are furnished with integrated maps of significant risks and they also receive reports on current and future exposure to operational risks. 4.12 UBI Banca is continuing with its commitment, first made in 2003 by the then BPU Banca, to apply ADOPTION OF the ten universal principles of the Global Compact (www.unglobalcompact.org) in favour of human EXTERNAL CODES rights, the protection of labour, environmental performance and conduct to fight corruption, in AND PRINCIPLES order to help create a more inclusive and sustainable global economy. 4.13 UBI Banca is a member of the Italian Banking Association and of the National PARTECIPATION IN Association of “Popular” Banks. Banks It also belongs to the Consorzio ABI Energia for ASSOCIATIONS energy efficiency in the banking sector and to the G8 Task Force on social investments [ SO5] and is a member of the Sodalitas Foundation (whose mission is to contribute to the development of the third sector and the growth of a corporate social responsibility culture) for which, amongst various initiatives, it supports the Sodalitas Social Innovation award. award 29 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement The Group CSR Manger attends the proceedings of the CSR Manager Network Italia, 1 EBEN Italia, the Banks and Civil Society Committee of Science for Peace and also, together with other colleagues, various working groups formed by the Italian Banking Association on specific social responsibility issues. Stakeholder engagement 4.14 The UBI Banca Code of Ethics defines Group stakeholders, dividing them into three classes: STAKEHOLDER • organisations and parties which by the nature of the relationships established or GROUPS ENGAGED investments made, hold an interest in the operations of the Bank (e.g. employees, customers, suppliers); 4.15 • organisations and parties affected by the external impacts of UBI Banca’s activities, MODALITY OF although they have formed no direct relationships with it (e.g. local communities and SELECTION OF economies); STAKEHO9LDER • organisations and institutions which hold the same interests as those described in the Codice Etico previous points and which are able to exert influence over the UBI (e.g. trade unions and p. 9-10 other organisations which represent stakeholders). The Group’s commitment is designed to continuously improve the quality of relations with its stakeholders and this includes consultation and discussion with them. Engagement activities are structured with consideration given to the intensity of the relationship and the breadth and urgency of the interests held by different stakeholders, in addition to the procedures laid down by specific legislation and regulations (e.g. Shareholders' Meetings, negotiations with trade unions) and established practice (e.g. investor relations). Registered and unregistered shareholders 4.16 The Investor and Media Relations Area is responsible for relationships with “equity” and “debt” APPROACH TO investors, analysts and the financial community as a whole, handling them with promptness and STAKEHOLDER care. Interaction with the financial community is based on continuous and open dialogue to give ENGAGEMENT prompt replies to the many demands for information and it undertook a series of initiatives in 2013 4.17 as follows: KEY TOPICS AND • 2 conference calls were organised when annual and interim results were approved; CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED • the participation as a speaker at seven international conferences for institutional “equity” THROUGH and “debt” investors; STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND • periodic meetings with Italian and foreign institutional investors and with analysts who RESPONSES cover the UBI Banca share. Senior management and/or the investor relations officer met more than 400 institutional investors, sometimes on more than one occasion (compared with 250 in 2012), thereby further increasing interaction with the market; • telephone or email contacts to provide information requested by analysts and investors in response, amongst other things, to the intense reporting activity required by continuous policy and regulatory developments in a year that was again difficult for Italy due to the recession and the slow recovery of confidence by markets. 1 A project launched by the Umberto Veronesi Foundation with the objective of promoting a culture of non-violence by advocating peace and making European governments aware of the need to reduce military investments and to allocate greater resources to research and social utility projects. 2 In order to encourage the fullest participation of those potentially concerned, all the invitations (prepared in the English language) are not only sent to a mailing list of analysts and investors, but are also communicated to the Consob and Borsa Italia Spa through the SDIRNIS network (the Borsa Italia regulated information network service) and published on the corporate website at the same time. A copy of the presentation is made available on the Bank’s website, in good time beforehand. 30 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement 2013 1 F IN AN CIAL CO MMUNICATIO N NO.

The number of contacts are the number of interactions, which may even be with the same parties, at different events on different dates. Activity involving direct contact with the financial community was accompanied by updating and expansion of the corporate website at www.ubibanca.it, now a fundamental tool also from a regulatory viewpoint to convey and broadcast corporate information to the public at large. In 2013 th the website was classified in 18 place overall and in second place among Italian banking groups in the Italian league table drawn up annually by the specialist web ranking company Hallvarsson & Halvarsson (KWD Group), which assesses the quality of the online corporate communication of 62 companies in different sectors. The Relations with Registered Shareholders Service is responsible for relations with registered shareholders and it proposes and co-ordinates initiatives for them. The registered shareholders section of the Group website provides information specifically of interest to registered shareholders and completes the information already available in the investor relations section. All registered shareholders receive a written communication – the “Letter to the Registered Shareholders” – at least annually, as the Annual General Meeting approaches, to keep them up-to-date on the financial and operating position of the Group and on projects in progress. The principal opportunities for engagement are Shareholders' Meetings. Meetings In April 2013, 14,568 registered shareholders took part in the ordinary shareholder’s meeting (46.4% in person and 53.6% by proxy). As already announced by the senior management during the Shareholders’ Meeting held in April 2013, a first information roadshow named “2013 Meeting with Registered Shareholders” was held in November with a view to encouraging more frequent and direct dialogue with the shareholder base. The programme consisted of four events organised in the cities of Bergamo, Brescia, Varese and Milan, respectively, selected because the largest percentage of UBI Banca’s Registered Shareholders live in those areas. They were attended by over 1,600 Registered Shareholders. The invitation process, designed to involve and facilitate the presence of the largest audience possible, involved not only sending hardcopy invites to the homes of all Registered Shareholders resident in the four cities and provinces selected, but also the creation of a dedicated website on which it was possible to register for the event directly. The overall organisation was carried out in co-ordination with the relative network banks present in the various provinces (Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banco di Brescia, Banca Valle Camonica and Banca Popolare Commerce e Industria). The meetings were covered by the local and national press due to the special nature of the initiative in the sector and to the success it enjoyed with the shareholder base. Employees The Group’s corporate intranet – UBILife – is an important tool for providing continuous information clearly and promptly, for involving people and stimulating participation and for sharing knowledge. Internal customer satisfaction satisfaction surveys were conducted in 2013 which, in a number of stages, involved a total of 11,000 employees who received over 25 thousand questionnaires by email on products services and software applications provided by units at the Parent, UBI Sistemi e Servizi and the product companies. 31 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement Customers [ PR5] In addition to complaints management, management which represent an opportunity to improve services, a “Consultation Project” Project” has been in operation for some years now with customers. It is a customer satisfaction survey conducted systematically by means of telephone questionnaires managed by a specialist firm (Istituto Piepoli). The community Following on from activity carried on in previous years, survey activity was carried out in 2013 by administering a special questionnaire over the Internet to a representative national sample of nonprofit organisations. organisations It addressed third sector perception of the Group’s social responsibility policies and commitments and recommendations for improvement The Group’s operational policies and commitment to social issues are little known on average to NPOs and this is the same for reporting tools such as the social report and the social responsibility section of the Parent’s corporate website. Nevertheless, when it is known, our commitment to social responsibility is perceived on average as a distinctive feature of our corporate culture (three on a scale of zero to four) and as a concrete commitment (3.2 points) not designed merely to improve our image. Again during the year, engagement activity was carried out with both public and private sector universities located throughout the country. This employed semi-structured interviews to explore the philanthropic and commercial relationship between banks and universities, with particular reference to the effectiveness of the design of specific services that banks provide for the world of education. Universities that have agreements with the Group expressed a positive opinion of their existing relationship and declared that they had considerable knowledge of both social responsibility policies and initiatives and of the reporting tools employed by UBI Banca. Particular appreciation was expressed for social bonds [ FS7], sponsorships of scientific and health initiatives [ EC8] and for the Enjoy Card for students [ FS7]. Universities also recorded a series of areas of improvement in the services provided by banks as follows: greater provision of unsecured loans to students by the bank; support for international student mobility; indirect support for university research by financing companies which enter into partnerships with universities for research into innovation; support for start-ups with strong links to universities. The media Relations with the media are managed by the competent organisational units to provide relevant and reliable information on the structure, activity, and financial position of the Bank, its policies and strategies, including social and environmental policies, and the impacts of action taken. Relations with the press are conducted on the basis of integrity, transparency, independence and equal treatment for each newspaper. Mirroring the communication strategy of UBI Banca, the network banks themselves work to obtain adequate coverage in the press (mainly local) for the various initiatives in which they are involved. During the year Investor and Media Relations staff processed approximately 200 requests for information on policy, products, new business models and so forth, which saw the involvement of the competent units in the Group on the issues involved. At Parent level two press meetings/conferences were organised and 57 press releases were issued, of which 42 of a financial nature and four on social initiatives. Critical analysis of press articles helps to identify the issues and operational aspects of most interest to the public and how the Group is perceived by public opinion. In 2013 UBI Banca obtained visibility in the Italian press in 7,302 articles, 41.5% of which described the Group and its banks in 32 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement 3 detail, with a readership of more than one billion. Local newspapers were again the media category most attentive to the activities of UBI Banca, followed by the financial media. Orientation of specialist press Newspapers and periodicals articles 8.5% 5.6% 7.4% 19.7% General national dailies 4.7% Financial national dailies Positive Local dailies Negative 14.9% Neutral Financial periodicals Other publications 86.7% 52.4% 4 The percentage of positive articles out of total high standing articles was 8%. while negative articles accounted for 5%. The increase in the neutrality of UBI Banca’s media coverage rose from 74% in 2012 to 87% in 2013 due to the large presence of articles on the issue of lending (RCS, Tassara, Tangenziali Esterne di Milano), which mention the Group as one of the many lenders without expressing any opinion on its operations. 3 Estimates of the number of persons who read the articles based on Audipress surveys. 4 Articles containing information on corporate structure and operating results, statements by senior executives and managers and on products and services which enable the public to form an opinion of the activities of the Bank. 33 Social Report 2013 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement FS. Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector UBI Banca contributes to the sustainable development of the local communities in which it operates, with attention paid to the social and environmental repercussions of its activities. It achieves this through its credit and commercial policies, which consider the demands of all customer segments (socially vulnerable consumers and small to medium-sized enterprises in particular), through business innovation to satisfy new needs and development opportunities (e.g. affordable solutions for the disadvantaged and services for nonprofit organisations in the community) and through specific policies to control and reduce social and environmental impacts (e.g. the Bank’s environmental policy and its armaments policy). All business policies and management approaches to the various economic, social and environmental issues that involve the financial sector are based on the principles and commitments to stakeholders defined in the Group’s Code of Ethics. Management approach FS1 UBI Banca has pursued a Policy on arms since 2007, which was updated in 2013. The revision ENVIRONMENTAL maintains the overall framework unchanged and refined exclusion criteria and procedures for the AND SOCIAL POLICIES assessment of countries for the authorisation of banking and financial transactions to support APPLIED TO BUSINESS additional international arms trading transactions carried out by Group customers. The policy bans business relations with companies involved in the production, development, storage, marketing and/or sales of arms of mass destruction and other controversial weapons (e.g. mines) and it involves an authorisation regime, for transactions involving international trade in arms, based on the country of destination. It applies to all the Group’s activities – with the exception of asset management, where the investment decisions are made with reference to market benchmarks and therefore are not based on screening on specific issues – and it involves periodic assessment of the foreign countries to which arms are destined or from which they come, except for those belonging to the European Union and/or NATO. The assessment of countries is carried out on the basis of criteria which consider not only international embargoes on arms, but also involvement in armed conflicts and/or the threat to security, peace and international security, violations of human rights perpetrated or tolerated by government authorities and the level of human development. The spirit, approach and criteria for assessing the policy basically conform to the Code of responsibility for finance to the arms industry developed by the multi-stakeholder working group “Banks and Civil Society”, in which UBI Banca participated as part of the initiative Science for Peace of the Veronesi Foundation. The number and value of the transactions involving international trade in armaments carried out in 2013 was extremely negligible compared with Group volumes of business and they are disclosed by country and type of counterparty and weapon in the report on the implementation of the policy which is published in the social responsibility section of the Group’s corporate website. A summary 1 of transactions carried out in 2013 at Group level is as follows : • 180 transactions for the receipt of €27.9 million (-84.4% compared with 2012) and two transactions refused for a total of €6.5 million for arms exports in accordance with Law No. 185/1990 (the largest percentage was 32.5% and regarded receipt transactions for exports to the United Arab Emirates); • 126 transactions carried out during the year for the receipt of €9.1 million (+15.2% compared with 2012) for the export of small arms (81.8% for exports to the USA). 1 The new legislation which came into force in 2013 repealed the law concerning requests by banks for authorisation to assist transactions involving international trade in armaments, which therefore no longer appear in the reporting, which leaves only a report of the transactions carried out. 34 Social Report 2013 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector No transactions have been performed as exceptions to the criteria of the policy since it was adopted. Policy on arms http://www.fondazioneveronesi.it/i-nostri-progetti/divulgazione/science-for-peace/i-gruppi-dilavoro#tab_16 No official policies are pursued with regard to other economic sectors with potential risk from a social and environmental point, or which are in any case considered critical by rating agencies and investors who adopt ethical criteria. Nevertheless, great attention is paid throughout the entire Group to avoid involvement in transactions which may present reputational risks, in compliance with general principles and rules of conduct in the management of relationships with customers contained in the Code of Ethics and the related Code of Conduct. More specifically, with regard to business in the gaming and betting 2 sector , the Credit Area of UBI Banca has invited the credit departments of the network banks to limit this business to a totally marginal level and to employ extremely rigorous conduct in assessing loan applications: parties operating in this sector must not only meet appropriate credit rating criteria, but must also be already known to and approved of by the Bank and satisfy criteria of absolute integrity, seriousness and reliability. 2013 2012 L EN DIN G PER CEN TAGE L EN GIN G PER CEN TAGE CO N TR O VER SIAL SECTO R S ( milio n s o f O F TO TAL ( milio n s o f O F TO TAL Eu ro) L O AN S Eu ro) L O AN S Arms and weapons system 34.5 0.06% 32.0 0.05% Tobacco 48.4 0.08% 49.4 0.08% Alcohol 27.0 0.04% 20.3 0.03% Furs 5.5 0.01% 5.6 0.01% Gambling 20.9 0.03% 18.6 0.03% Nuclear TO TAL 1 3 6 .3 0 .2 2 % 1 2 5 .9 0 .2 0 % The 2012 data on the arms, tobacco and fur sectors have been adjusted as a result of a more accurate identification of the counterparties and industry codes (ATECO). An environmental policy has been in force at Group level since 2008, designed not only to progressively reduce direct environmental impacts, but also to provide incentives for virtuous conduct along the value chain through the choice of commercial, credit and purchasing policies. Environmental policy Special policies and operational and control procedures are in place on the other most important aspects of banking operations concerning consumer protection, market abuse, conflicts of interest, transparency, privacy, usury, money laundering, the fight against terrorism and crimes covered by Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 on the administrative liability of entities. These are constantly updated to comply with changes in legislation and best practices. FS2 The assessment of environmental and social risks is present in all the Group’s activities, although PROCEDURES FOR not based on specific official procedures, except for the armaments sector [ FS1]. Processes to ASSESSING assess the creditworthiness of businesses also include qualitative information on social and ENVIRONMENTAL environmental aspects of operations. In the project finance area, in order to receive finance, AND SOCIAL RISKS IN projects must have passed the authorisation procedures set under Italian law (environmental BUSINESS impact, declaration of the start of activity, single authorisations, building permit, etc.) and the technical, legal, administrative and insurance assessments performed on behalf of the Bank by major independent advisors of international standing. 2 The organisation of gaming and betting in those European countries which allow it is managed by central governments which subcontract operations to private sector companies in return for the payment of license fees. In Italy, laws allow gaming and betting activities to be run by companies authorised by government, which intends in this manner to exercise stringent control over a highly profitable sector with a high risk of illegality. 35 Social Report 2013 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector FS3 No specific standards or performance expectations are set in finance contracts with companies, PROCESSES FOR except with regard to the implementation of the armaments policy, concerning the involvement of MONITORING corporate customers in the production, development, storage, marketing and/or sales of arms of CLIENTS’ mass destruction and other controversial weapons (e.g. mines).

Compliance with these declarations is monitored on the WITH basis of information disclosed in the press, by analysts, social organisations and pressure groups. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED INCLUDED IN AGREEMENTS OR TRANSACTIONS TRANSACTIONS FS4 Training on corporate social responsibility and on the Code of Ethics commenced in 2011 continued PROCESSES FOR in 2013 with approximately 1,150 hours of online training.

SPECIFIC SOCIAL BENEFITS Access to credit and support for families in difficulty In view of the continued difficulty in gaining access to credit and meeting the relative costs, the Group has continued with the various institutional initiatives launched in prior years for families hit by economic crisis as follows: • the “Loan Loan of hope”, hope the result of an agreement between the Italian Banking Association and the Italian Episcopal Conference, for families that have lost all income from work, have no unearned income or income other than that generated by the ownership of a home or ordinary or extraordinary state redundancy benefits. It is designed to implement projects for the return to work or the start-up of small businesses (242 loans granted in 2013 for €1.4 million); • the “Newborns’ Newborns’ Loan” Loan [ www.fondonuovinati.it] for families with a child born or adopted in the period 2009-2014 (over 340 loans granted in 2013 for a total of over €1.6 million); • the “Young Young Couples’ Fund”, Fund an Italian Banking Association initiative, provides the guarantees needed to obtain a mortgage for young couples or even single parent families with young children with “atypical” or temporary employment contracts to purchase a first home (10 mortgages granted in 2013 for over €1.1 million). At the end of 2013 the Italian Banking Association and the Department of Youth signed a “New Protocol”, to which the Group has adhered, which simplifies conditions for access to the fund. In 2013 the Group adhered to the new “Solidarity Solidarity Fund for Mortgages” Mortgages for the purchase of a first home, home set up by initiative of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance (MEF), which if certain conditions are met, allows a customer to apply for the deferment of repayments not more than twice for a maximum period of not longer than 18 months in the life of a mortgage, for mortgage contracts for the purchase of a main dwelling. This initiative combines the two prior initiatives (“2010 Solidarity Fund” and “Families Plan – Italian Banking Association Moratorium”) making them simpler and more effective operationally. Repayments were deferred in 2013 on 371 loans for a total remaining debt of €41.8 million. The Group is traditionally very active in the grant of home purchase mortgages and in May 2013 it launched a commercial campaign entitled “Love Love is a wonderful home home” me to advertise mortgages for the purchase of a first home by young couples, even with temporary or “atypical” employment contracts. The mortgage contract allows repayments to be deferred for one year (twice in the life of the loan) to meet the requirements of workers suffering temporary difficulties, such as for example workers on temporary contracts who remain temporarily unemployed or workers laid off on state benefits for indeterminate periods. This advertising campaign led to considerable growth in grants of new home purchase mortgages in the second half of the year and allowed the Group to grant a total of €1,422 million in 2013 (+3.87% compared with 2012 and +10.7% net of mortgages granted to workers on normal employee contracts) in a market context of a contraction in demand (-3.6% compared with the previous year). In consideration of the serious economic and employment crisis which has hit the country, after adhering in 2009 to the National Convention with Confindustria (confederation of industry) and Confederation of trade union organisations and trade associations on the question of advances on Cassa Integrazione Guadagni Straordinaria (the extraordinary state redundancy/lay-off scheme) (extended until 31/12/2015) benefits, Group banks signed specific agreements also in their major local markets including Brescia, Cuneo and Milan. In confirmation of the Group’s closeness to its traditional local markets, it also signed a series of locally important agreements which included a convention with the San Bernardino di Milan Foundation, as part of a microcredit initiative organised by the Archdiocese of Milan, designed to support families hit by loss of the main source of income by one or more of its members, by facilitating the grant of loans by means of a guarantee fund. At this difficult time of economic crisis, the social function of pawn credit – one of the most ancient 38 Social Report 2013 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector th forms of lending practised by the Monti Di Pietà set up in the 15 century by the Franciscan monks to combat the phenomenon of usury. Pawn credit provides immediate cash in return for the pawn of valuable objects to meet temporary financial needs not only of families and the more vulnerable groups in the society, but also of small shopkeepers and businessmen. Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria has nine credit branches in operation with an annual turnover of over 72 thousand policies for a value of approximately €77 million. The duration of pawn lending transactions is between three and six months and this results in a fast turnover of the capital financed with average total outstanding loans of €32.9 million (+1.4% year-on-year) with an average of 34,971 active policies (+1%). Savings In order to respond to the savings difficulties of less well-off households, the Group provides fund-fundbased savings plans, plans which allow small sums to be put aside (starting from €50 per month) according to the amounts savers can afford. As an incentive for these fund-based savings plans offered by the Group, no load brokerage commissions are charged. In 2013 75,140 fund-based savings plan contracts were stipulated (+17.9% compared with 2012). On the other hand, in order to respond to the need to diversify investments, including investments 3 in refuge assets, diamonds from “Diamond Love Bonds” can be purchased in branches of Group banks. All the diamonds offered by Diamond Love Bond to UBI Banca customers are certified “conflict free”, free” i.e. they do not come from conflict areas or from transactions to finance armed groups and conflicts. They are also guaranteed “child labour free” i.e. they are not the result of mining and processing activities which use child labour. The very young and students In order to educate young people to save through through games, games UBI Banca has created two special products with high rates of interest and prizes for achieving set savings goals: the Clubino savings book, for children from up to 12 years of age [ www.clubino.ubibanca.com], and I WANT TUBì, TUBì a current account for teenagers aged 13 to 17 [ www.iwanttubi.ubibanca.com]. At the end of 2013 there were 97,987 very young Clubino customers and 12,882 I WANT TUBì customers. In order to help young people with their education, the banks in the Group were among the first in Italy to offer unsecured student loans through convention arrangements with local universities. Since 2011 the Group has adhered to the “Give them a future” initiative organised by the Youth Ministry and the Italian Banking Association, to grant subsidised loans to young students (over €500 thousand granted in 2013 to 100 students). Co-operation with the main universities present on the local markets on which the Group operates is also continuing through the distribution of the prepaid card Enjoy. Enjoy This card combines typical banking functions with specific university services (over 27,000 cards issued at the end of 2013): the cards are used as payment instruments for university services and as identity cards or student record books. In 2013 the Group also started to work with some senior high schools. As part of co-operation between the Group and the European Investment Bank, the creation of a th new loan pool was agreed for 30 June 2014 to be used for loans at subsidised interest rates for companies that recruit young people aged up to 29 or that provide training schemes for young people. 3 Diamond Love Bond is a diamond company located in Antwerp authorised by the Belgian Ministry of the Economy, Commerce and Energy, with an international organisational network and it is present on all world diamond exchanges.The company adopts rigorous ethical principles. It follows and supports the UN Global Compact principles and adheres to the rules of conduct for Diamond companies – best practices recommended by the World Diamond Council System of Warranties and by the Diamond Trading Company – and it adheres to and complies with the Kimberley Protocol designed to break the link between illegal diamond transactions and armed conflicts. 39 Social Report 2013 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector Natural disasters In order to assist the people and businesses hit by the earthquakes in Emilia Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto, in addition to initiatives already undertaken in 2012 and partly continued in 2013 to defer repayment of loans for individuals and businesses resident or located in the areas hit by the earthquakes, the Group has launched further initiatives: • the continued availability in 2013 of a loan pool totalling €60 million for unsecured loans and subsidise conditions for businesses and individuals who have suffered earthquake damage (in 2013 the network banks involved granted 188 loans for over €10.3 million drawn from that loan pool); • adhesion – following on from the previous similar initiative in 2012 – to the convention signed by the Italian Banking Association and the Cassa Deposito e Prestiti (CDP – state controlled fund and deposit institution) for the grant of subsidized loans to population groups hit by earthquakes for the payment of taxes. As before, the repeat of this tax moratorium in 2013 enjoyed little success among customers throughout the banking industry; • adhesion – in the name of the network banks operating in the areas hit by the earthquake – to an Italian Banking AssociationAssociation-CDP convention agreement which established procedures for the use of a loan pool of €6 billion for use in granting loans for the repair or reconstruction of housing or business properties damaged by the earthquake. In view of the complexity of the necessary formalities, the deadline for submitting subsidy applications to the competent authorities by the potential beneficiaries was in most cases st extended until the 31 December 2014 and the first significant data on network bank loans will be available in the first half of 2014; • the creation, as part of co-operation with the European Investment Bank,Bank of a special loan pool for businesses hit by the earthquake from which loans totalling €10 million have been granted. Again as part of co-operation with the European Investment Bank, subsidised loans were granted in 2013 to businesses hit by a tornado in the Milan area in July 2013 drawn from a loan pool entitled “Credit Now” amounting to €11.5 million (of which €7 million from Group funds and €4.5 million from EIB/Finlombarda funds). “Anti-Crisis” measures to support small to medium“Antimedium-size enterprises During the year, the Group banks participated in a series of measures to help businesses and firms on their respective markets, co-operating with public institutions (chambers of commerce, regional and provincial governments) and guarantee bodies. Anti-crisis measures already launched since 2019 to support small to medium-size businesses rd continued. These included the implementation, amongst other things, of the 3 August 2009 “Joint th Announcement”, the “Agreement on Loans to Small to Medium-Size Enterprises” of 16 February th 2011, “New Measures for Credit to Small to Medium-Size Enterprises” of 28 February 2012 and the grant of loans drawn from Cassa Depositi e Prest Prestiti funds (3,600 loans for a total amount of €190 million were drawn from the “fourth Convention” and usable in 2013) and recourse was made to government credit risk mitigation instruments such as the “Guarantee fund for SMEs ” pursuant to Law No. 662/1996 (€373 million granted to give a total €843 million of outstanding loans). UBI Banca again adhered to various anti crisis agreements proposed by the sector nationally. Two agreements are still in force “New measures for credit to Small to MediumMedium-Size Enterprises” (an th initiative launched in 2012 for which the validity was extended until 30 September 2013) and the “2013 Accord for credit to SMEs” (signed by the Italian Banking Association, Alleanza Cooperative Italiane, CIA [Italian farmers confederation], CLAAI [an artisans association], Coldiretti [the direct small farmers’ association], Confagricoltura [a farmers association], Confapi [an SME association], Confedilizia [a builders’ association], Confetra [a transport companies’ association], Confindustria [confederation of industry] and Rete Imprese Italia [an Italian businesses network]). These allow for the deferment of repayments on the principal of mortgages, other loans and lease instalments and the rescheduling of loan repayments. At the end of 2013, 2,900 transactions were outstanding at Group level, mainly medium to long-term loans for a total of approximately €964 million. Almost all the applications meeting the requirements for eligibility were accepted. 40 Social Report 2013 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector Activities continued relating to the loan pool entitled “Italy Investment Projects” to finance SME investment projects and to a “Public Administration Receivables” loan pool to release funds consisting of payments due from public administrations (€600 million allocated by UBI Banca for each of the two loan pools). The Group granted 1,270 loans for over €70 million drawn from the “Italy Investment Projects” loan pool while 600 loans for approximately €21 million were granted from the “Public Administration Receivables” loan pool. Convention loans for businesses Agreements with guarantee bodies and trade associations are an important factor for us in connecting with local economies to facilitate access to credit for small to medium-size enterprises. Today the Group has approximately 180 convention agreements with guarantee bodies in different local areas. At the end of 2013 total outstanding loans backed by guarantee bodies and by guarantee funds, funds such as the Guarantee Fund for SMEs (pursuant to Law No. 662/1996) and the fund managed by the SGFA (fund management company for the agricultural and food sector) for agricultural concerns, amounted to approximately €3.7 billion. New grants during the year related to 18,873 transactions, amounting to €1,368 million. These loans include “anti-nti-usury” credit lines, lines which give better terms and conditions than ordinary loans because they are backed by guarantees (1,271 loans outstanding at the end of 2013 for over €27 million). Reports and Accounts 2013 p. 47-48 2 “C2 Community for the Community” bonds In order to support local businesses and provide a concrete answer to the strong concerns at system level nationally over credit rationing for the real economy, during the year UBI Banca 2 2 launched the project T Territorio per il Territorio (C Community for the Community), Community) which involved the acquisition of funding – through the issue of dedicated bonds – to be injected back into circulation by making credit lines available under competitive conditions destined to support communities in the Group's local markets. The following loan pools were created in 2013 as a result of initiatives undertaken by the Parent or Group banks in co-operation with local networks of organisations and associations (e.g. trade associations): • €10 million for the benefit of companies who are members of the Cuneo Confartigianato (artisans’ association) following the issuance of bonds for €5 million by Banca Regionale Europea; • €20 million for companies enrolled in the Lecco Chamber of Commerce and who are members of the the main local trade associations and member companies of the Como Confindustria (confederation of industry) and the Como API (now Unindustria Como – SME association) following the issuance of two instruments for a total of €10 million by Banca Popolare di Bergamo; • €40 million for the benefit of member companies and institutions or associates of Confapi (SME association), following the issuance of instruments listed on the MOT (electronic bond market), for a total of €20 million by UBI Banca and placed by Banca Popolare Commerce Industry, Banca Popolare Di Bergamo, Banco di Brescia, Banca Regionale Europea, Banca di Valle Camonica, Banca Popolare di Ancona and Banca Carime. At the end of 2013 approximately €51 million of loans had been granted from a loan pool totalling approximately €195.1 million (of which €60 million had not matured in 2013). Initiatives are planned to develop the customer base in 2014, in co-operation with both national and local trade associations and institutions.

Processing of Bank of Italy BIP data (online Base Informativa Pubblica – tables TDB 10290 and TDB 10295) by the UBI Banca Studies Service.The funding includes current account deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposit. 42 Social Report 2013 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector investment at a market interest rate, requires the issuing bank either to allocate a set quota of the funding acquired (normally 0.5%) to support projects of high social value undertaken by nonprofit organisations, or to pay the entire amount of the funding acquired into a loan pool for the grant of loans to third sector economic initiatives. In 2013 24 new bonds were placed (17 in 2012) of which five of the Parent, for a total of €238.7 million (with an increase of 20% compared with €198.5 million in 2012), which made it possible to make donations of €1.18 million [ EC8] and for Banca di Valle Camonica to create a loan pool of €2 million as part of a joint project with the Opera Caritas San Martino Foundation. With technical assistance from the Italian Association for the promotion of a co-operation and nonprofit culture (AICCON), UBI Banca continued its activity with the Observatory on finance and the third sector, sector established in 2011 by UBI Banca, to process and disseminate data annually on the financial requirements of the third sector. The observatory’s new publication regarded the results of a survey on a sample of associations to investigate their financial needs and to analyse trends for social entrepreneurship compared with the first survey carried out in 2011. The training programme designed to ensure the presence of qualified staff in branches who understand the particular nature of nonprofit realities continued again in 2013 [ LA10]. In December 2011, an Enjoy Special Edition card account reserved to employees of the Group was launched in relation to the UBI Community project, with customised graphics and the ability to make donations to support social and charitable activities. In 2013 commissions on payment transactions made during the year using POS terminals were allocated by Group banks to the ACRA Foundation charity project – ranked first among four projects considered in a survey of employees carried out on the Bank’s intranet entitled UBILife [ EC8]. Treasury services This segment includes public authorities and those institutions for which the banks in the Group provide treasury and cash services (at the end of 2013, 1,986 services of this type were managed). The treasury management and payment and collection services contracts signed involve the payment of contributions to these authorities to support their institutional goals [ EC8]. In the last part of the year the Group started a feasibility analysis to put an integrated platform in place for management of public authorities’ tax revenues and capital income and the relative reporting in order to bring the treasury and cash services into line with regulations on the digitisation of relations between public administrations and users. Assistance to schools continued in 2013 to facilitate their adoption of “IT Orders” Orders” procedures and more generally of all that was necessary to implement the contents of the “cash convention scheme” with the relative attachments published by the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research. Attention focused on schools allowed the Group to increase the number of authorities managed by 15.2%, up from 508 in 2012 to 606 at present. Roll-out of the IT Ordinance during the year by more than 200 schools and approximately 40 other institutions for a total of 466 public authorities operational at the end of the year, made it possible, to date, to transfer approximately 42% of documents to automated processing procedures. Various training and information initiatives delivered by the Group in 2013 to public authorities were undertaken during the year to provide support and assistance needed for the migration to SEPA and a commercial initiative was started – on the basis of the results, amongst other things, of customer satisfaction surveys [ PR5] aimed at public authorities and their employees to satisfy their numerous banking and non-banking requirements. 43 Social Report 2013 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector FS8 The initiative Forza Sole (Sun Sun Strength) Strength is a product for individual customers to finance domestic PRODUCTS AND photovoltaic systems covered by specific insurance policies (approximately 150 loans concluded in SERVICES WITH 2013 for a total of over €2 million), while a varied range of products in terms of type of finance and SPECIFIC the object of the investment exist for businesses. Outstanding loans of €3.9 million existed at the ENVIRONMENTAL end of 2013. BENEFIT For businesses the product “Renewable Renewable energies” energies finances the production of energy from renewable sources and from solar power, wind power and biomass cogeneration in particular, while “New Photovoltaic Energy” finances photovoltaic installations inclusive of tangible investments like land and building work, advisory services, feasibility studies, the designs and the technical appraisals. The grant of loans is subject to a series of verifications of the project (business plan and technical report), the authorisations and permits required by the regulations in force, the selection of instruments for the repayment of the loan and the technical appraisal of the project required for loans of over €350 thousand. At the end of 2013 outstanding loans of €3.2 million existed for renewable energy projects (there were no new grants during the year), while outstanding loans of €300.3 million existed for photovoltaic projects, of which €12.7 million granted during the year. A new loan pool of €100 million for investments was agreed with the European Investment Bank in July 2013 to finance large investments in renewable energies at subsidised interest rates. The previous loan pool of €200 million had been fully used during the year. 2013 2012 2011 PR O JECT F IN AN CE ACTIV ITIES TO TAL PR O JECT GREEN TO TAL PR O JECT GR EEN TO TA L PR O JECT GR EEN A N D GR EEN PRO JECT F IN AN CE PR O JECT F IN AN CE PR O JECT F IN AN CE PR O JECT F in an cin g g ran ted d u rin g th e year Numbers of contracts 16 16 0 20 10 10 34 19 15 of which for renewable energy 6 6 0 17 7 10 25 10 15 Amount authorised (€ milion) 400 400 0 332 296 36 889 800 89 of which for renewable energy 41 41 0 132 96 36 253 164 89 Amount disbursed (€ milion) 416 416 0 207 179 28 451 368 83 of which for renewable energy 36 36 0 122 94 28 221 138 83 F in an cin g ou tstan d in g at th e en d o f th e year Numbers of contracts 136 91 45 137 87 50 118 78 40 of which for renewable energy 112 67 45 111 61 50 94 54 40 Amount authorised (€ milion) 2,248 1,978 270 1,869 1,598 271 1,814 1,571 243 of which for renewable energy 1,263 993 270 1,094 823 271 1,007 764 243 Amount disbursed (€ milion) 1,744 1,487 257 1,489 1,236 253 1,324 1,092 232 of which for renewable energy 1,112 855 257 1,065 812 253 944 712 232 In addition to banking products, “Full Full Power” Power lease products were also distributed by UBI Leasing for investments in renewable energy (13 leases granted in 2013, of which 8 increases amounting to €8.3 million accounting for 2.2% of the total granted during the year and a total of 394 lease contracts existing for residual debt of €648.4 million, accounting for 9.7% of total). Again in 2013, the UBI Banca Project Finance Finance Unit maintained a good presence on the renewable energy market even if new transactions decreased due to a significant reduction in the tariff incentives in the photovoltaic sector. The “Green Project” product was incorporated into the Project Finance Unit during the year for organisational reasons. Consequently the performance of the Green Project product is no longer reported separately. 2013 2012 2011 PR O JECT F IN AN CE O PER ATIO N S IN NO. PO W ER PO W ER NO. PO W ER PO W ER NO.

Economic performance performance The business mission of UBI Banca is to create value for its registered and unregistered shareholders and for all its stakeholders, in a manner that is sustainable in the medium to long-term. In this respect operating performance is not only important in itself but also as a condition for achieving positive social and environmental performance. Economic performance EC1 The year 2013 ended with a consolidated net profit of €250.8 million compared with €82.7 million DIRECT ECONOMIC in 2012. Net operating income was up on 2012 (+2.85%) thanks to significant savings on costs, VALUE GENERATED which more than offset the contraction in income . 1 AND DISTRIBUTED At the end of the year, loans to customers amounted to €88.4 billion (-4.8% compared with 2012). Group lending was affected mainly not only by the economic environment characterised by continuing weak demand, but also by the progressive discontinuation of some higher risk activities (primarily the non-captive business of the former Banca 24/7 and UBI Leasing) and by the disposal of Banque de Dépôts et de Gestion in November 2013. Despite this, signs of improvement seen in the third quarter were confirmed again in the fourth quarter of the year, in relation to new loans granted by the Group’s network banks. Gross deteriorated loans (non-performing loans, impaired loans, restructured and past due/in arrears loans) amounted to €12.7 billion in December 2013 compared with €11 billion in December 2012. Although the economic scenario was still one of recession, 2013 nevertheless recorded slower growth in total deteriorated gross loans, a reduction in migrations of performing loans to deteriorated status (-4.2%) and growth in return migrations from deteriorated to performing status (+22.7%). Total direct funding was €92.6 billion (-6.3% compared with 2012). The annual performance was primarily the consequence of action taken to optimise funding as a whole, designed to reduce the marginal more costly components, consisting mainly of institutional and large corporate accounts (more volatile and more expensive) and term deposits. From a balance sheet viewpoint, the Group has been Basel 3 compliant for some time and it compares favourably with the figures published by major international banking groups. The phasedin Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated on the basis of Basel 3 rules is again higher than 10%, the short-term (liquidity coverage ratio) and the medium-term (net stable funding ratio) liquidity indicators are greater than one and financial leverage according to Basel 3 rules is 5.1%, significantly better than the 3% requirement. On the basis of the rules in force as at 31/12/2013, the Core Tier One Ratio stood at 12.6%, the Tier One Ratio at 13.2% and the Total Capital Ratio at 18.9%. The Management Board submitted a proposal to the Shareholders’ meeting to pay a dividend per share of €0.06 on all outstanding shares on the ex dividend date, with the exclusion only of treasury stock.

IMPLICATIONS, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Minor impacts may occur in relation to supply processes, especially with regard to fuel and DUE TO CLIMATE electricity costs and commercial and lending processes relating to the occurrence of extreme CHANGE climatic events which could affect the operating capacities and solvency prospects of corporate clients (a risk which is, however, mitigated by the high sector diversification of the Group’s lending). The issue of the fight against and adaptation to climate change involves investments by individuals and businesses, both to comply with changes in regulations and the efficiency standards for production processes and products and also to develop and use renewable energy sources. Following on from action taken in prior years, the Group has developed specific financing, finance lease and project finance products for these purposes [FS8]. EC3 All Group employees benefit from supplementary pension plans through either internal or external COVERAGE OF pension funds, which involve a defined contribution by the employer as part of supplementary BENEFIT PLAN company labour agreements. Employees may also allocate a part of their salaries to supplementary OBLIGATIONS pension schemes. Coverage for commitments resulting from internal funds, consisting of defined benefits, is performed by allocating amounts to the “provision for risks and charges: pension and similar obligations”, which are subject to periodic actuarial measurement in compliance with IAS 19 “Employee benefits”.

The Group’s Code of Ethics states that where requirements are the same, preference is given to those suppliers who demonstrate the implementation of good practices of social responsibility and/or possession of social or environmental certifications. To ensure the independence of suppliers, we seek to avoid the establishment of exclusive business relationships, or those characterised by excessive financial dependence on the Group (the total amount paid to each Group supplier must not exceed 25% of the supplier’s total turnover). Suppliers who provide goods and services to the Group on a regular basis or occasional suppliers who supply goods and services for amounts greater than €30,000 are registered on a list of approved suppliers managed by the Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi. The approved list contains preferred suppliers for each type of good and service, listed on the basis of quality (50% weighting), competitiveness (25% weighting) and financial and capital soundness (25%) and we periodically assess them with the involvement of budget managers, the Purchasing Department and an outside database. Suppliers of utility services (local water companies, gas companies), landlords of rented properties and institutional suppliers (e.g. Italian Banking Association and CONSOB Italian securities market authority) are excluded from management on the list of approved suppliers. Suppliers on the list numbered 763 in 2013 (+100 compared with 2012), as a result of 63 new suppliers and 163 removed from the list. Contractual conditions and terms of payment are constantly updated to comply with the legislation in force and with market conditions on the basis of periodical monitoring. Supplies which are not regular or for small amounts, and considered not strategic and which do not carry a high operational risk are regulated by the general conditions of a standard contract, while specific contracts are drawn up for recurring, strategic supplies, which carry high operational risk or which are for large amounts. All suppliers are required to fully comply with legislation and regulations to protect the rights of workers, which in particular means observation of national trade union agreements for the sector to which they belong and of pension, accident prevention and insurance legislation along with specific legislation on health and safety. Additionally, all suppliers are required to comply with the principles of the Group’s Code of Ethics either when orders are placed or contracts signed. EC7 Selection in 2013 was oriented towards commercial roles for recruitment in the network banks, in HIRING FROM LOCAL order to implement generation turnover projects contained in Group business plans. The PERSONNEL recruitment policy was therefore designed mainly to assess candidates resident in the local areas where they would work in order to make use of their local knowledge. Search and selection activity benefited also from constant co-operation with schools, training institutions and local universities. No new senior management appointments were made in 2013. 50 Social Report 2013 Economic performance Indirect economic impacts EC8 The UBI Banca Group pays great attention not only to local economic development, but also to DEVELOPMENT AND promoting social and cultural activities through its support to a huge number of Church and other IMPACT FOR nonprofit organisations in the community with donations and sponsorships. This approach is an INFRASTRUCTURE expression of its mutual spirit as a co-operative, with action taken for which the articles of INVESTMENTS AND association of UBI Banca and the various Group banks require the allocation of a share of the SERVICES PROVIDED distributable profits (the maximum percentage allocated varies, where specified, between 1% and PRIMARILY FOR 4%). This activity helps to strengthen and promote the identity of the Group and the individual P0UBLIC BENEFIT network banks and has no direct correlation with the achievement of commercial objectives, THROUGH except for cause-related marketing initiatives. This action is not the result of rigid and COMMERCIAL, IN predetermined policies and guidelines, but of contingent assessments – based on criteria of the KIND OR PRO BONO ENGAGEMENT consistency, efficiency and effectiveness – of the initiatives taken and projects commenced in the community. The relative decisions are taken at local level by individual banks and foundations, with support from UBI Banca for the more far-reaching projects. There are no particular areas of intervention defined a priori, except for the foundations, formed over the years precisely to promote social and cultural growth in their local communities, for which the scope of intervention is laid down in their respective constitutions.

Even when they are for professional sports clubs, the contributions included in the reporting are nevertheless aimed at promoting the moral education of young people through sport. The Group also makes donations to assist with the activities of Pro Solidar, Solidar a national fund in the banking sector for solidarity and charitable initiatives consisting of a bilateral entity managed by the Italian Banking Association and the national secretariats of the banking trade unions. It is the first body in the world formed by a national trade union agreement and funded on an equal basis by workers and companies. Each employee may contribute a sum of €6 per year deducted directly from salary, against which the company pays in an equal amount. As part of the Group’s philanthropic activities, UBI Banca develops partnerships with the larger organisations and participates in more far-reaching initiatives not strictly linked to specific local areas. The main donations and sponsorships in 2013 included those relating to scientific research as follows: co-operation with the International Centre for Competitiveness Studies in the Aviation th Industry (ICCSAI) in the organisation at Bergamo of the 17 edition of the ATRS World Conference; co-operation with the Einaudi Studies Centre on the Annual Report on the Global Economy and Italy, co-ordinated by professor Mario Deaglio of Turin University, presented in Group network banks with the aim of offering an initiative of national scope locally and of “localising” the report at the same time, thanks to the involvement of local businesses; support for the Research Foundation of the Ospedale Maggiore hospital in Bergamo (of which UBI Banca is one of the founding members), with the aim of promoting and financing scientific research activity of particular social interest; a partnership between UBI Banca and the Italian Association for research into cancer (AIRC) for the period 2013-2015, in which UBI Banca works side-by-side with the AIRC as an institutional partner in the fundraising campaign named “the research days” and contributes through various initiatives (e.g. the issuance of social bonds, fundraising at branches and through Internet banking, “payroll giving”) aimed both at customers – current and prospective – and employees. This campaign, which met with great success in the media both nationally and locally, allowed the AIRC to raise funds of approximately €6.7 million, of which €650 thousand directly attributable to the various initiatives organised by our Group. 52 Social Report 2013 Economic performance Action taken to assist education involved above all the provision of scholarships: a scholarship for one pupil in the fourth year of senior high school for a year of study abroad (academic year 201415) with the Intercultura Foundation onlus and one in memory of avv. Corrado Faissola to support the attendance of a student on a masters course in investment management at the Lubin Business School of Pace University in New York, in co-operation with Brescia University. University Action taken in the field of art and culture was also significant. It included continuation of coth operation with the Brescia and Bergamo International Pianoforte Festival Organisation for the 50 edition of the annual festival of the same name, entitled “From Michelangeli to Sokolov. Fifty years with the masters of the pianoforte”, enhanced again this year with a teaching initiative for young people led by the famous violinist Uto Ughi; support for the “John XIII and Paul VI: the Pope’s of Vatican II” convention, organised jointly by the Pope John John XIII Foundation of Bergamo and the Paul IV Institute of Brescia; the restoration of the Astino Monastery, founded in 1070 by the Vallumbrosan monks (in 2007 it became the property of the Order of the Misericordia Maggiore of Bergamo MIA Foundation, to which the Bank’s donation will be made); a donation to the Ambrosian Veneranda Library of the Cardinal Federico Borromeo Foundation, Foundation for the purpose of promoting and disseminating culture and art. One of the most important initiatives in the field of welfare and solidarity is the organisation of “Solidarity Christmas Dinners” for people suffering hardship for the fourth consecutive year coordinated, by the Internal Communication Unit and supported locally by the Group network banks. They were provided in co-operation with the Exodus Foundation and the initiative took place simultaneously in seven different towns and cities in which the network banks have their headquarters and involved over 200 employees who served dinners and entertained over one th thousand guests in need. Organisation of the 13 edition of the Concert at the Scala of Milan Theatre was also of importance, a fundraising evening for research and assistance organised by the Italian League League for the Fight Against Tumours (LILT), (LILT) and a project to refurbish paediatric clinics for the Ospedale dei Bambini hospital at the Azienda Spedali Civili of Brescia. In the economics field, UBI Banca supported the Cathay Pacific Business Trader Award for the fourth consecutive year, a prestigious international award for Italian companies that have excelled on Asian markets for their innovation, technology and know-how. Donations were also made to the 2013 Franciacorta Festival, Festival an event which involved the Franciacorta cellars in the organisation of wine, gastronomic, cultural and artistic events in the Franciacorta cellars. The result in terms of image in local and provincial newspapers and on national television was very good. Third sector activity included support for the Sodalitas Social Innovation prize, which the Sodalitas Foundation founded to help improve the general planning ability of the third sector and the development of partnerships with businesses thereby helping nonprofit organisations to draw up high-quality social business plans. Yet again in 2013 UBI Sistemi e Servizi donated retired electronic equipment, which nevertheless still functions well, to various organisations and associations which requested it, for an estimated value – on the basis of reconditioning costs – of €6,406: 26 beneficiaries (11 voluntary associations, three schools, two police units, three administrative authorities, seven schools) received 73 personal computers (of which 26 notebooks) one photocopy machine and one coin counting machine. Donations were made through the issuance of “UB Community” social bonds to the CESVI Foundation onlus (to help the people of central Uganda return to food self-sufficiency), to the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Foundation (for scientific research into the field of genetic and neurodegenerative diseases), to the IRCCS Mario Negri Pharmacological Research Institute (for the voluntary and clinical study of Alzheimer’s disease) and the San Patrignano Foundation (the “Dog helps man” project). 53 Social Report 2013 Economic performance As part of its over one hundred years of activity as a local bank, yet again in 2013 this bank made donations to numerous social initiatives, both directly through support for social, recreational, sports, welfare and charitable activities and also through the donations of the Banca Popolare di Bergamo Foundation Onlus and the Unione di Banche Italiane per Varese Foundation Onlus. While many donations are made in the field of welfare and solidarity, those to the Casa Amica Foundation the Don Chino Pezzoli Promozione Umana Community and the Don Mazzi Exodus Foundation, Foundation Onlus to fight against addiction or to rehabilitate marginalised and misfit individuals or those suffering economic hardship are certainly worthy of mention. The “Solidarity Christmas” initiative was undertaken again at Christmas to bring some joy and happiness to some of the main hospitals and care homes in the provinces of Bergamo, Varese, Lecco, Brianza and Rome, demonstrating a different way of being a “local bank”. In the field of recreation and sports, support was given to the Goggi UBI Banca Ski Club,Club to the partnership with the Bergamo international tennis tournament and more generally to numerous sports associations, which show the bank’s commitment to the practice of sports above all as an occasion for bringing people together and educating young people. Particular appreciation was shown by the organisers for the support given to the Binda Di Cittiglio Trophy, Trophy a female cycling World Cup trial which took place in March on the roads of Luino and Valcuvia and to the Women’s National Road Cycling Championships, Championships national events which followed weeks of campaigns to promote the use of bicycles and environmental and ecological awareness in numerous schools in the province of Varese. Long-established annual donations to the Bergamo section of the Italian Alpine Club are also worthy of mention, an association of which Banca Popolare Di Bergamo has always been a deserving member, and which seeks always to support mountain climbing among the young and the protection of the mountain environment. In the cultural field support was again given to the initiative “Verba Manent – the strength strength of words”, words” consisting of a series of meetings with representatives of the world of culture, economics, theatre and art which in the framework of the splendid Teatro Sociale, have enhanced the partnership between the Banca Popolare Di Bergamo and the City of Bergamo. Support for other now well-established initiatives is also important, such as the Gaetano Donizetti Foundation concert season, season the “Clusone Jazz” and the “Summer at Sarnico” events and support for the Italian Environment Fund on the occasion of periodic exhibitions at the “Villa e Collezione Panza” at Varese. We did not forget support for local development and promotion, which included a presence at the Bergamo fair centre where the bank participated with sponsorships and other types of co-operation in numerous events promoted under the banner of the Bergamo Fair Organisation. Organisation In addition to the traditional Trade Fair in October some of the most successful sponsorships included the Marriage Fair, Fair Lilliput, Lilliput Creattiva, Creattiva the Building Building Fair and Gourmarte. Gourmarte One of the high points of the events that took place in the attractive setting of the Bergamo Sentierone was the Booksellers Fair in cooperation with Confesercenti (the retailers’ association) and the Festival of the Environment. Environment Attention was paid and support given also to the green economy on the occasion of the event “Masters of the landscape”, landscape” which attracted agronomist, urban planners and landscapers from all over the world to Bergamo and transformed the Piazza Vecchia of Bergamo Alta into a true and genuine botanical garden. Banca Popolare di Bergamo was also an official partner at the Varese and at the Monza trade fairs, fairs demonstrating its commitment to making its presence more widespread and incisive even beyond traditional Bergamo borders. With the issuance of social bonds, the bank supported the following: the Centro di Aiuto al Bambino Maltrattato e alla Famiglia in Crisi Onlus (CAF) to improve its psychological educational service for children between three and twelve years of age who are victims of serious maltreatment at three residential communities in Milan, the AOB Associazione Bergamasca Onlus to support its “emergency oncological diagnostic service”; the Maria Letizia Verga Committee Onlus with its project “Come on let’s build it together!” for research into leukaemia in children; the Varese section of the Italian Red Cross for the purchase of a goods lift for the soup kitchen at its 54 Social Report 2013 Economic performance headquarters in via Dunant; the Dottor Ambrosoli Memorial Hospital Uganda Foundation for the “Safe Pregnancy Programme” to fight maternal and neonatal mortality in northern Uganda and the Malawi nel Cuore Association Onlus to support the poor and food shortages in developing countries. This bank strengthens its local roots through intense social activity too. In addition to funding the Banca San Paolo di Brescia Foundation and the Credito Agrario Bresciano – Giovanni Folonari Institute of Culture Foundation, founded to pursue the original ideals of the banks of the same name from which they emerged, the Bank also carefully selects events and organisations to give support directly, above all in the fields of social, recreation and sports, and welfare and solidarity activities. Of the numerous activities supported, the Mille Miglia and Brescia Rugby sponsorships in the sports field are worthy of mention. Donations are made in the artistic and cultural field to the Teatro Grande of Brescia Foundation for its theatre season and in order to contribute to the cultural heritage in local areas it contributed to the publication of the book “La Chiesa di Santa Maria della Carità in Brescia” (a 2013 Christmas gift art edition).

In order to enhance its image as the Group’s main bank in the city of Milan, in the cultural sphere, this bank is an institutional supporter of the prestigious Poldi Pezzoli Museum and it is listed on the “Golden Roll of Honour” of the supporters of the Piccolo Teatro of Milan, Milan with which it manages th and organises the Eleonora Duse Theatrical Prize, Prize which is now in its 28 edition this year. th On the occasion of the celebrations for the 125 anniversary of the foundation of the bank, the performance of the Nutcracker by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky was put on at the Piccolo Teatro Strehler Theatre by the Scala Theatre Academy School of Ballet.

In the cultural sphere, the bank confirmed its partnership in the Piedmont area with the Turin Museums Foundation and for Palazzo Madama in particular, and it gave its support to the Regio Theatre of Turin for the 2013-2014 opera season and to the Circolo dei Lettori, with which it organises interesting initiatives on economic and financial subjects and also to educate young people on savings and investment, assisted by support from the Italian Banking Association’s PattiChiari Consortium.

Action taken to renew support for the activities of the Federazione derazione Nazionale Nazionale Sport Invernali Paralimpici (FISIP – Paralympic National Federation of Winter Sport) and, in football, support for AC Cuneo Calcio 1905 for activities in the youth sector, were of important social significance. In Liguria, where the bank acquired Banco di San Giorgio which was merged into it at the end of 2012, partnerships with prestigious organisations in the area continued: for example in the health sector support was given to the San Martino Hospital of Genoa by making two important (Cauvin Cauvin Memorial Memorial) orial scholarship grants for research into haematology .

An initiative to facilitate further study by postgraduate university students is in honour of the memory of Nicola Calipari, Calipari a “hero” of Calabrian origin, who in dramatic circumstances in an operation abroad acted as a shield with his life to save that of another. More generally, as part of the bank’s attention to schools and school children, its commitment continued as part of financial education initiatives promoted by the PattiChiari Consortium to teach economic and financial subjects in senior high schools in the provinces of Bari and Barletta-Andria-Trani.

Exhibitions were also organised dedicated to the Copper Age and in November one entitled “Oltre lo Sguardo” on the contemporary artist Franco Rinaldi, both held in the Diocesan Museum of Brescia. Although to a reduced extent, support continued for artistic and cultural initiatives organised with associations that work in various areas with which the Foundation has been linked for some years: the FAI, FAI the Amici dei Musei Association (friends of museums association), Artisti Bresciani Association the Ugo da Como Foundation and the MusAssociation, Mus-e Brescia Onlus. Onlus FONDAZIONE BANCA SAN PAOLO DI BRESCIA Founded in 1998 by the bank of the same name, its objective is to perpetuate its original ideals and Catholic inspiration. It operates principally in Lombardy and preferably in the province of Brescia, to support social, civic and church initiatives with special attention given to education, welfare and art, and it also works with other similar organisations. In 2013 the Foundation made donations above all in the areas of education, universities and research providing support to the training and research activities of the Opera per l’Educazione Cristiana of Concesio for studies carried out by the Paul VI Institute of the Brescia Catholic University of Milan, by the Cesare Arici Institute of Brescia and the Santa Maria della Pace Primary and Secondary School. Schoo Important action was taken in the field of culture and art which included the following: support for the activities of the Modern Art Study Centre of the Arte e Spiritualità Association of Concesio; 59 Social Report 2013 Economic performance donations to the publishing houses Editrice Morcelliana and Edizioni Studium; Studium and support for welfare and solidarity initiatives which included donations to the Diocesan Caritas of Brescia for a soup kitchen for the needy and to the VOL.CA – Prison Volunteers to support prison inmates, former prison inmates and their families. The Foundation also supports various Church-related organisations, refunding interest paid on loans granted by the Banco di Brescia on the basis of special agreements entered into for restoration and conservation of artistic heritage and of properties belonging to the parishes and dioceses of Brescia. FONDAZIONE UNIONE DI BANCHE ITALIANE PER VARESE ONLUS The Foundation was established in 2004. In accordance with its constitution the Foundation pursues exclusively social solidarity aims and its institutional object is the protection, promotion and enhancement of things of artistic and historical interest and also health and social welfare assistance. These aims are pursued within the Region of Lombardy and in the province of Varese in particular. In 2013 the Foundation gave support above all in the field of welfare and solidarity making donations to the following organisations: the Red Cross of Valceresio and the S.O.S. di Malnate Onlus for the purchase of ambulances; the Anaconda CoCo-operative for a theatre project with the disabled; the Mario Ravera ANFASS Association to expand its community accommodation; the Varese AVIS for the purchase of a new motor vehicle; and the Casa Don Guanella for the purchase of health aids for the non-self-sufficient elderly. The Foundation also made a significant commitment in the field of art and culture. The largest donations were to the Parish of San Vittore di Varese to complete the restoration of the baptistery, to the Parish of Azzio to restore the “Chiesa del Convento” and to the Paul VI Foundation for the theatre project “Tra Sacro e Sacromonte”. Finally significant donations were also made in the field of education and scientific research to the following: the Foundation gave its support to the Audiologica Foundation for the creation of a scholarship; the Friends of the University Association for a research grant; the Schiaparelli astronomical Society to complete the “Galileo” telescope, the Cooperativa Mediazione Integrazione Onlus for a cultural mediation project. FONDAZIONE BANCA POPOLARE DI VIGEVANO Founded in 1991 by the bank of the same name which was merged into Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, it has continued over the years to support local initiatives of a humanitarian, social, cultural and charitable nature. In 2013 the Foundation contributed in the welfare field to the installation of a new lift in a home for the disabled and made a donation of remote first aid equipment to the local Red Cross. Cross Initiatives were also promoted in the welfare and training field on dyslexia, awareness on the subject of violence against women and on voluntary work, while for local development purposes the project Vigevano Smart City was supported for the redevelopment and promotion of the city. 60 Social Report 2013 Economic performance EC9 The economic and financial crisis still in progress has underlined the critical importance of the SIGNIFICANT banking system in relation to sustainable growth, especially in the current context of the INDIRECT ECONOMIC interdependence of local economies and the globalisation of financial services. EFFECTS Given its nature and its distribution network in the community, the UBI Banca Group can generate significant indirect impacts on the economy, especially at local level: • the competitiveness of the economy, as a result of support to medium-sized enterprises to promote growth and technological innovation and to manage the crisis; • the development of depressed economic areas, through geographical choices for the location and allocation of economic resources; • the development and promotion of new business opportunities and the reduction of environmental costs through support for investments to develop and use renewable energies and through attention paid to environmental factors in lending, investing and purchasing processes; • the reduction of risks and the maximisation of the social benefits of development through attention to issues such as financial inclusion, a civil economy, financial education, occupational health and safety, non-discrimination and equal opportunities. On a national scale, UBI Banca can help reduce the social costs of economic inequalities, illegal conduct and threats to peace and security to the extent to which: • it contributes to the efficiency and stability of the financial system through proper risk management, monitoring the market, respect for supervisory authorities and proper commercial practices in dealings with customers and competitors; • it observes the law and co-operates with institutions in the performance of all activities where risks may arise (e.g. in competition and market abuse, money-laundering, terrorism, privacy and consumer protection). UBI Banca takes these issues seriously, both in the formulation and implementation of policies and commercial and production practices and it accounts for them through its financial and nonfinancial reporting (Consolidated Financial Statements and Social Report), even if it is difficult to indentify metrics and operating tools to measure the impacts. 61 Social Report 2013 Economic performance EN. Environmental performance performance In compliance with the principles of the Global Compact, UBI Banca pursues a preventative and proactive approach to environmental issues, as part of its social responsibility with regard to society and the local communities in which it operates. To achieve this, in 2008 it set an environmental policy designed to both progressively and gradually reduce direct environmental impacts in terms of consumption (principally energy, paper and toner), greenhouse gas emissions (principally CO2) and the production and disposal of waste and the implementation of initiatives in order to promote virtuous conduct along the value chain with reference primarily to customers.

In 2012 the measurement of consumption of the various types of paper was refined. Therefore data are not comparable with the previous years. The main raw material used is paper. paper The Group is continuing with its commitment to increase the use of paper with a low environmental impact, both because it originates from responsibly managed forests and because of the manufacturing processes, and also to optimise its consumption with activities such as remote monitoring of printers and “paperless” document processing. Three main lines of action have been taken on “paperlesspaperless” paperless processing as follows: • that for documents documents, with digitisation extended to include the management of nonperforming loans and the unsecured guarantee database; • that for digital signatures, signatures which allows the production of digital documents right from the outset, with the conclusion in 2013 of the experimental stage of the graphometric 1 signature project and the release of software application infrastructure support to all Group branches in the first months of 2014; • that for replacement conservation for which the project to insource previously outsourced activities at UBI Sistemi e Servizi was concluded, not just for greater security but also for the cost advantages with a view to the conservation of growing volumes of digitised documents. The spread of the service entitled Le mie contabili (my accounts) is of great importance as part of the project to develop the “multi-channel banking” project. This service, further enhanced in 2013, allows all users of the internet banking service (Qui UBI and Qui UBI Affari) to receive most of the documentation which the bank normally sends by ordinary mail in electronic format free of charge. Approximately 780,000 customers have been registered for the service (an increase of 30% compared with 2012) with over 1,100,000 accounts signed up. A further increase in the documents 1 Biometric/graphometric technology can be used to place a naturally produced digital signature on documents and that is the placing of a graphics stroke on a special tablet that is able to “capture” the five characteristic traits of individual handwriting: the rhythm, speed, pressure, acceleration and movement. 62 Social report 2013 Environmental performance available online is planned in 2014 with the extension of the service also to include QUI UBI Imprese internet banking and the possibility to ask for the electronic receipt of correspondence also for those customers not registered for internet banking services. At the end of the year remote digital signatures were introduced on the Remote Selling Selling platform which allows those who wish to purchase Group products and services online to complete the purchase without the need to print and send hard copy documents. EN2 To date the Group has introduced no specific guidelines for the purchase of products produced RECYCLED RAW using recycled materials. Training on the sustainability of purchases will be given to Group buyers MATERIALS planned for 2014 with regard to this possibility. Energy Energy EN3 The optimisation of energy supplies and consumption is a priority and it is overseen by the Group DIRECT ENERCY Energy Manager who, in addition to managing energy supply contracts (electricity, methane, gas oil, CONSUMPTION BY etc.), makes recommendations to the different organisational units responsible on the rational and SOURCE efficient use of energy sources. EN4 The Group is a member of the Italian Banking Association Energy Consortium, Consortium which acts as a INDIRECT ENERGY research and training centre for energy savings and advice and it also co-ordinates cost analysis and CONSUMPTION BY data acquisition as well as making group energy purchases at attractive conditions.

EN5 Again in 2013 the Group paid particular attention to the reduction of waste and energy ENERGY SAVED DUE consumption through the implementation of an Energy Management Management programme. TO CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY A substantial contribution to reducing consumption and emissions is made by the properties and IMPROVEMENTS eco-compatibility of buildings. The Group has adopted a design system for the construction and refurbishment of offices and branches, which brings them constantly into line with technological advances available on the market. The system involves an energy section with three lines of action: • electricity electric lighting, with a system that guarantees constant levels of lighting and ity and lighting reductions in consumption partly through the possibility of the partial use of individual lamps; • machinery and plant, plant with high efficiency energy equipment such as refrigeration units with heat pumps fitted with inverters, high-performance condensing boilers with low harmful gas emissions; 64 Social report 2013 Environmental performance • architecture and structure, structure with greater use of insulation and film on windows to control sunlight. This reflects up to 70% of the incoming heat, maintains interior temperatures of buildings lower and reduces the need for air conditioning. In 2013 windows were replaced in seven branches with profiles and glass compliant with the architecture and structure of the system. In five branches heat generators were replaced with new high performance plants and new high performance heat or refrigeration pumps were installed in 70 branches. Six central heating systems were converted to methane with an increase in performance and a reduction in emissions, including two belonging to large buildings, and a long term methane conversion project was launched with a request for gas connection for one of the most energy devouring headquarters located in Milan from the viewpoint of gasoil consumption. Finally, a firm was engaged for the executive development of a long-term plan to install photovoltaic panels at the management headquarters of Banca Carime in Bari. A remote control system is used to control 314 air conditioning and heating systems (of which 34 since 2013) via intranet, for which the correct settings for the required ambient temperature and on and off times are verified constantly both in winter and summer. An energy audit was commissioned for two UBI Sistemi e Servizi buildings at Brescia and Bergamo – the highest energy devouring buildings of the Group – and for the management headquarters of Banca Popolare di Ancona at Jesi, in order to identify the most appropriate action to take to increase energy efficiency in terms of cost-benefits. Another two energy audits were commenced for other buildings in Bergamo and Milan. The Department of Energy at Milan Polytechnic was commissioned to conduct a study to identify action to contain the energy consumption of the data processing centre at Brescia. A system was installed in order to carry out the study to measure the following energy flows: PUE (efficiency indicator for the data processing rooms), IT and air conditioning/heating power consumption, environmental temperature. The spaces occupied by personnel at the Banca Carime headquarters were compacted in order to avoid inefficiencies in consumption by optimising the per capita occupation of floor space. In order to reduce consumption by computer equipment, 2,848 latest generation PCs were purchased as part of the renewal of the PC fleet. fleet These guarantee lower power consumption. Work station monitors all have the following energy efficiency certifications: TCO display 5.0, TCO 03 and Energy Star, Star while all notebooks, desktop PCs and printers have Energy StarStar certification. The introduction over the last 24 months of server virtualisation has allowed the consolidation of approximately 2,000 departmental servers on approximately 100 physical servers fitted with energy consumption functions which automatically adjust to requests for processing capacity, with a consequent automatic reduction in power consumption during periods of inactivity by software applications. Lastly, implementation of the policy to turn off signs was completed and tender procedures were set in motion to install LED signs if existing signs malfunction or are replaced. EN6 In consideration of the activity carried out, the indicator is held to be significant, not so much with INITIATIVES TO regard to products and services that are energy efficient in themselves or that are based on PROVIDE ENERGY renewable energy, as with regard to the supply of products and services designed to support EFFICIENT OR investments for energy savings and the use of renewable energy as reported in the section on RENEWABLE ENERGY products and investments for environmental purposes [ FS8]. BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 65 Social report 2013 Environmental performance EN7 The Group has undertaken various initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption connected INITIATIVES TO with the mobility of employees. These regard the following: a travel policy which gives priority to REDUCE INDIRECT the use of collective public transport for business travel [ EN17]; increasingly greater use of video ENERGY conferencing to replace physical travel [ EN18]; and the use of company buses for travel to and CONSUMPTION AND from work [ EN18]. In order to reduce the consumption of electricity purchased, when THE REDUCTIONS refrigeration and lighting units are replaced preference is given to the installation of highACHIEVED performance equipment [ EN5]. Water EN8 The water used is supplied exclusively from the public water mains. Therefore there are no other TOTAL WATER sources that can be significantly affected by the volumes of withdrawal. WITHDRAWAL BY SOURCE Action was taken in 2012 and 2013 on around ten condensed water air conditioning systems to reduce water consumption by replacing some of these with air condensed models and by carrying out repairs on the rest to eliminate waste. The activity will also continue in 2014. 1 W ATER CO N SUMPTIO N ( Cu .m) 2013 2012 2011 Water withdrawn from the public mains 358,217 692,015 671,502 per employee 20.46 38.75 37.60 The significant reduction in water consumption reported for 2013 depends only in part by the decrease in the number of employees and the extraordinary maintenance carried out. Since the calculation of consumption is made on the basis of the invoices received from suppliers and since their billing is often not accurate and can be based on alleged consumption, the figure for 2013 could be affected by significant adjustments on high billings of previous years.

OZONE-DEPLETING Almost all of the new air conditioning systems installed in offices contain the non-polluting R410 SUBSTANCES refrigerant gas, while some remaining systems still use the R22 gas as well non-polluting R407 and R134 gases. With regard to the R22 gas, the maintenance firms which repair gas leaks have been asked to furnish reports on maintenance intervention carried out, giving the quantity of gas used to top up the system to the correct level for the functioning of the equipment. The quantity of the gas introduced into the systems repaired during the year amounted to 939 kg of which 220 kg was regenerated R22 gas .

Candidates are acquired through the “Work” section of the corporate website of the Group and over 39,000 CVs were received during the year. The selection procedure involves various stages of aptitude and behavioural tests, Group assessment and individual interviews to foster mutual knowledge and it not only considers the professional training and experience of candidates but also their human experiences. Selection procedures involved approximately 1,500 candidates in 2013, with a focus on new university graduates and professional and middle management roles in various specialist areas. In 2013 UBI Banca took part in career days and company presentations organised mainly by schools and universities in the areas in which the Group operates, in order to let young people know the type of qualifications and experience in which the Group is interested, to acquire candidates and to carry out preliminary and counselling interviews, During the year 57 persons were appointed on internships in co-operation with these institutions, of which 38 were university undergraduates or graduates and 19 school leavers.

There are eight trade union organisations in the BY COLLECTIVE Group to which 82% of employees belong. All trade union organisations operate freely without BARGAINING restrictions and the Group makes adequate operational means available to them to conduct trade AGREEMENTS union activities. In 2013 trade union representatives took 30,334 days of trade union leave. Relations with trade union organisations are based on the search for agreement, as far as possible, on solutions to the issues which are discussed from time to time, through transparent, concrete and continuous dialogue even beyond the minimum required by institutional procedures. Work on trade union relations was intense in 2013 with 95 trade union meetings held for a total of 380 hours, both to carry out negotiations in relation to the 2011-2013/15 business plan and to sign other agreements at Group and single company level. th At national level, on 16 September 2013 the Italian Banking Association officially informed trade unions that it was withdrawing from the national labour contracts in force (senior management, th middle management and staff in professional areas), which were due to expire on the 30 June 2014. Following this, the national secretariats of the trade union organisations took various initiatives, including the declaration of a one-day strike and the interruption of industrial relations in all companies in the sector. This national initiative accounted for 98% of the 84,534 hours of absence from work for strikes that occurred during the year. The remaining hours regarded other action declared by trade unions, again at national level, for reasons connected with the economic and political affairs of the country. In December the Italian Banking Association and the national secretariats of trade union organisations reached an agreement to increase the “Solidarity Fund” to comply with the 1 provisions of the Fornero Law (Law No. 92 of 2012) . The parties to the agreement took the opportunity to set a calendar for meetings starting in February 2014 in order to draw up a new contract. Mutual satisfaction with the agreements reached made it possible to resume trade union relations in all companies in the sector. LA5 Important organisational changes were implemented in full compliance with the procedures set out MINIMUM NOTICE in the Banking National Labour Contract which sets a minimum period of 45 days for negotiations PERIODS REGARDING with trade union organisations. Great attention was paid with the reorganisation measures, which OPERATIONAL met important requirements to improve and rationalise the organisation, to minimise repercussions CHANGES for workers with regard to retraining, geographical mobility and reconciliation of work with family time. The change of role and retraining processes were managed with priority given to enhancing human and professional resources, pursued also by proposing related training programmes. Intragroup mobility is managed, insofar as it is possible, as an opportunity for the occupational growth and enhancement of individuals, by assigning employees with new duties consistent with their qualifications, experience, potential and aptitudes. Organisational changes were made in 2013, including action planned under the 2011-2013/15 Business Plan, with trade union negotiations which led to agreements being signed at Group and single company level. They included: • an agreement relating to the merger of Centrobanca into UBI Banca. The operation itself did not involve any employment problems. The approximately 90 staff in excess were found positions within the Group by using flexibility tools (intragroup mobility, secondment, equivalent duties) provided for under the Framework Agreement of 29th November 2012; • the agreement to create an additional customer assistance service centre at the UBI.S units at Cosenza and the change at the same time in the numbers of staff employed at the 1 The law makes it compulsory to create a system which ensures adequate support for all workers in cases of the reduction or suspension of working hours for causes specified in the legislation itself in sectors not covered by state lay-off benefits schemes. The credit sector, already protected in this respect by Ministerial Decree No. 158/2000, complied with the provisions of the law in question. 76 Social Report 2013 Labour practices and decent work customer assistance service units at the UBI.S centres in Milan, Brescia and Varese. The customer assistance service is a key part of the multichannel strategy and forms part of a plan to simplify Group organisation designed to contain overall labour costs. Implementation of the above required the adoption of limited geographical mobility measures, some transitory, and also recourse to intragroup secondment of individual employees or groups of workers and measures which are accompanied, where necessary, with appropriate training and retraining courses for staff; • an agreement to centralise the governance and supervision activities carried out by UBI Leasing, UBI Factor and Prestitalia at the Parent with the objective of further reinforcing the Parent’s governance processes which concern Group companies. The operation did not have any particular consequences in terms of occupational mobility, while it did require some transitory geographical mobility measures. Reports and Accounts 2013 p. 68-69 Occupational health and safety Occupational health and safety matters are regulated in great detail by Legislative Decree No. 81/2008, the provisions of which are applied in all Group companies. A function was created at the Parent, on the staff of the Chief Operating Officer, which has the duty of overseeing implementation of legislation on the matter throughout the Group and to officially fill the role of the Prevention and Protection Service for those Group companies for which a specific service provision contract is in place. The function is constantly supported by a leading consulting company. L A6 In accordance with article 35 of Legislative Decree No. 81/2008, annual meetings are held in all WORKFORCE companies, attended by company representatives (the employer and its representatives), the REPRESENTED IN manager and the staff of the Prevention and Protection Service, the Corporate Physician and FORMAL JOINT workers safety representatives, where appointed. Additional meetings are held, sometimes MANAGEMENTseparately, between the Prevention and Protection Service and each of the parties mentioned WORKERS HEALTH above, to study specific issues in detail. The Manager of the Prevention and Protection Service is AND SAFETY also periodically convened by the 231 (administrative liability) Supervisory Bodies and/or by the COMMITTEES Boards of Statutory Auditors and takes part, as Group representative, in the proceedings of the “health and safety working group” formed as part of the Trade Union and Labour Department of the Italian Banking Association Trade Association. The health and safety management system based on UNI-INAIL (Italian standards authority and Italian national accident insurance institute) guidelines was officially approved in December by the Management Board and the Supervisory of the Parent and will be progressively rolled out in all Group companies. The health and safety management system adopted, which will include audit and annual review procedures, will improve oversight and general awareness of safety issues in all the units involved. Furthermore, compliance with UNI-INAIL guidelines will allow a discount to be granted on the annual accident insurance premium which INAIL allows to companies which can demonstrate that they have made improvements to health and safety over and above that required by the legislation. LA7 Again in 2013 the banking sector confirmed what had been recorded in previous years with regard INJURY, DISEASES to low levels of hazard for the risk of injury in work environments and processes. In the INAIl AND ABSENTEISM statistics it was positioned in the lowest class in terms of absolute severity, the frequency and seriousness of accidents, with the majority of total injuries occurring while travelling. The Group is perfectly in line with the sector and pursues special policies designed to reduce road accident risks at the source, by encouraging the use of public transport for work activities and by making collective transport facilities available, where restructuring processes result in significant travelling requirements for personnel. For potential sources of accident risk normally present at the workplace (such as those connected with the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of properties and the relative wiring and services, 77 Social Report 2013 Labour practices and decent work in addition to continuous work to educate personnel performed by staff at UBI Sistemi e Servizi, which manages relations directly with the suppliers who perform the work, in cases of accidents attributable to failings or omissions by maintenance firms), the failings observed have been officially contested and the firms reminded of the safety obligations agreed to in contracts. In order to constantly monitor accidents that occur at the workplace (and therefore with the exception of those that occur while travelling and when not working on company premises, on a mission or during a lunch break) a precise reporting process has been introduced by the administrative units responsible for maintaining contacts with INAIL and the Prevention and Protection Unit. The latter makes records of all accidents on the basis of the events which led to the accident and of the causes due to failure to implement maintenance and faulty maintenance or design of workplaces, with the objective of taking appropriate technical action to mitigate risk. No fatal accidents occurred either travelling to and from or at work in 2013. 2013 2012 2011 A B SEN CE B Y GEN DER ( N O .

Risk situations are also recognised and managed, as part of the Prevention and Protection Service, that are connected with excess stress due to work organisation, however, it is not possible to report the number of days of absence resulting from that cause because in order to ensure the right to privacy, the medical certificates do not state the type of illness, but only the prognosis. Primary prevention in this area takes place through the use of human resource management policies and by setting behavioural standards based on the principles contained in the Code of 79 Social Report 2013 Labour practices and decent work Ethics. Nevertheless psychological assistance is available by going through the Corporate Physician, who co-operates with human resources staff for the management of individual cases of stress. LA8 LA8 Risk prevention and control activity was focused on the following aspects in 2013: EDUCATION, • completion of the project to introduce a health and safety management system (HSMS) TRAINING, based on UNI-INAIL (Italian standards authority and Italian national accident insurance PREVENTION AND institute) guidelines as concrete implementation of the guidelines already contained in the RISK-CONTROL FOR 231 Management and Organisation Model. Once the risk assessment and gap analysis THE HEALTH AND stage was complete on activities considered sensitive in terms of compliance risks and on SAFETY OF WORKFORCE procedures and practices currently in use, documentation was drawn up which will MEMBERS AND THEIR constitute Group regulations on health and safety, which has been submitted to the FAMILIES Management Board and to the Supervisory Board for official authorisation by the end of the year. The necessary formalities will be adopted by Group companies in the first months of 2014, in order to roll out the HSMS throughout the whole Group; • development of the work work--related stress evaluation process both through the acquisition, processing and comparison of numerically relevant objective data – from which no particular critical situations emerged – and through the assessment of perceived workrelated stress, conducted in co-operation with a leading university institute by means of anonymous questionnaires given to staff. The process will provide aggregate responses for homogenous groups of workers and it will allow these phenomena to be analysed. This should highlight significant differences from the average level of acceptability for the risk and identify improvement action; • the prompt elimination of “technical” risks with a high magnitude reported by the Prevention and Protection Service and the identification of statistically significant risk situations which might arise during the design, implementation and maintenance of workplaces. Technical specifications have been refined with regard to external suppliers, suppliers who are required to document the conformity of their activities in greater detail and to update IT procedures already available to Group staff for reporting the emergence of new risks and/or malfunctions; • the constant implementation of effective technical and organisational measures to deter crime (robberies robberies and thefts). thefts In 2013 the Group suffered 42 robberies (three more than in the previous year after an uninterrupted progressive and significant reduction in the number of robberies). The increase in the number of robberies is basically limited to Milan and Naples and can be considered linked to the rundown social and economic context. In the case of serious robberies (64% of total robberies) both individual and Group psychological assistance is provided on the basis of experience acquired over the years. It is given by professionals who have worked with our Group for some years now and who also provide specific training with classroom sessions for all staff; • implementation of the Group training programme in compliance with the provisions of the State-Regions Conference Accord.

The Group training catalogue, updated in 2013 to comply with the new regulations on prevention, 80 Social Report 2013 Labour practices and decent work contains different programmes for staff at headquarters and those in branches, with both classroom and self-training, which differs for ordinary staff and safety officers. In consideration of the delicate supervision role played by safety officers, in addition to training initiatives which involved a significant number of employees in 2013, an easy-toconsult booklet was published on the most common matters for which they are responsible. In order to increase personnel awareness of the importance of behaviour consistent with respect for their own health and those of others – also in implementation of the principles and contents of the Code of Ethics – a section exists and is kept up-to-date on the Group intranet portal UBILife dedicated to health and safety. The following can be easily found on it: references to laws and Group regulations; news on safety organisation in the Group (e.g. emergency plans and exit routes to follow in different premises illustrated by actual photographs); material used in classroom training initiatives; and also useful advice and information on correct life-styles to remain in good physical and mental condition. Prevention All operational units are subject to programmed inspections and on-site visits on the basis of reports received from workers’ safety representatives, trade union organisations and personnel from the operational units themselves or on the request of departments in the Group. All new units and also those subject to restructuring are inspected within 90 days of becoming operational. The inspections may generate a series of “recommendations” to the functions normally responsible for the removal of the risk (Safety Officer, Real Estate, Security), which are entered into the IT system for managing the state of progress of the action taken to solve the problems.

The doctors promptly report any problems which may be found during visits in order to identify the best solutions to improve or solve them. During the year some Group companies were requested to produce documentation on progress with the implementation of regulations concerning the assessment of work-related stress, by public authorities responsible for monitoring compliance with prevention regulations as part of regional monitoring of determined economical sectors from year to year. Following a Local Health Authority inspection of ventilation systems for the underground premises of a Group branch, an ordinance was issued, which was withdrawn on compliance with it according to the procedures and times set, together with a fine of €1,300 which was paid. 81 Social Report 2013 Labour practices and decent work LA9 No formal agreements were signed in 2013 with internal trade unions on health and safety topics. HEALTH AND SAFETY TOPICS COVERED IN FORMAL AGREEMENTS WITH TRADE UNIONS Training and education All training activities are managed by UBI Academy, Academy the Group consortium company [ 2.3] responsible for planning and providing life-long learning and professional and managerial development for the personnel of Group companies. In order to assist in the achievement of these goals, UBI Academy has entered into partnerships with national and local institutional knowledge centres (universities and business schools), consistent with the Group’s social responsibility policies. The measurement of requirements and the formulation of training programmes is performed on a periodic basis using a variety of complementary tools: annual meetings with the Human Resources Departments of Group banks and companies, focus groups on specific career families, indications from the Group Commercial Plan and training needs detected from the skills survey, in which all Group employees are involved. Appropriately structured and integrated with other systems for the development of human resources and accompanied by intense internal communication, training proposals are designed to be effective tools for improving and enhancing human assets consisting of technical and professional know-how, managerial experiences and skills and the ethical and cultural conduct of each worker and for developing corporate identity and culture through the dissemination of Group values and strategies. The instructors involved in training activity consist of both colleagues from Group banks and companies and also outside professionals. The in-house instructor corps consists of over 450 staff, who taught on courses in 2013 for a total of almost 34 thousand training days (approximately 62% of total classroom training). Training and refresher courses for the instructor corps are organised in training and qualification programmes on the best techniques for teaching, classroom management and diffusion of virtuous conduct. Instructors are responsible not only for imparting knowledge but also for facilitating the sharing of experiences, positive examples and distinguished conduct in order to diffuse a common language, values and corporate culture and a sense of belonging to the Group.

Forty percent of total training activity was designed to enhance the technical and professional skills (operational, commercial, credit and financial) of branch network work personnel as follows training on credit subjects increased substantially compared with 2012; the subject insurance accounted for a significant portion (33%); while updates on regulations amounted to around half that delivered in the previous year (12% in 2013, 20% in 2012). In order to reinforce managerial skills for roles carrying responsibility, ranging from managers of central units to Branch Managers, training action in 2013 focused on the ability to “be enterprising”, i.e. on consolidating capacities for vision and strategic awareness, energy and proactiveness, innovation, risk management and driving and motivating workers, with the aim of increasing individual and team performance. The range of discussions on economics, political and social issues held in meetings with leading managers, businessmen, academics and university luminaries was increased through greater co-operation with leading firms specialising in management culture training. The behavioural programme paid specific attention to staff over 55 by means of a survey to identify their training needs and the design of specific training consisting of three voluntary initiatives to enhance their professionalism. Other training activities included “the culture of inclusion” in professional life, for staff who voluntarily wish to reflect on gender differences designed to achieve greater efficiency in business and “balance, work and family” designed for women returning to work after maternity leave. With regard to initiatives for younger personnel, after the Masters in the “Management of banking companies” held in co-operation with the Milan Polytechnic MIP, a second University Masters was launched in 2013 on “Company finance and the creation of value” lasting two years, held in cooperation with the Management Department at the University of Turin at the Cuneo site, on which 15 young staff from Banca Regionale Europea enrolled. The two-yearly Instructor Corps Convention was held in 2013 which saw the establishment of the commercial, credit and risk management faculties to consolidate the co-ordination of the Instructor Corps in the transmission of key messages to staff in these specific areas. Group companies contribute to Joint Inter-professional Funds for the FONDIR Continuous Professional Development (fund for senior management training) and to the F.B.A. (fund for the training of the employees working in the credit and insurance sectors Fondo Banche Assicurazioni). Applications for training programmes for a total of approximately 226,300 hours of training, with over 40,000 participants, were submitted in compliance with the contents and the specifications of the notices and they were subsequently approved by the F.B.A. and FONDIR funds. All the training programmes submitted were agreed with the trade union organisations of the individual banks and companies involved except for the FONDIR notices for which the trade unions signed agreements at national level. 84 Social Report 2013 Labour practices and decent work Internal communications Training activities are supplemented by intense internal communication designed to convey the Group’s values and strategies and its main projects. The goal is to help improve corporate efficiency by sharing knowledge and by creating involvement and participation and to guide processes of change with initiatives to promote and reinforce Group identity. The corporate intranet portal, UBILife, UBILife is the main tool for internal communication and became fully established in 2013 as a space that was constantly used by employees. During the year “centre stage” news on the homepage carried news on daily professional activities to provide information on Group life and strategies and important projects and new procedures. The corporate periodical YOUBI Magazine can be accessed from the intranet with the daily publication of articles on professional and other subjects, all of which can be commented on by users on a blog which is always open. In 2013 the “Professional Professional Communities” Communities were launched, areas reserved to specific professional communities where documents and experiences can be shared. The first social environment created and today fully operational is that reserved for the “Community Community of the developers”of developers all the Group Network Banks. The second edition of Almanacco YOUBI was published in 2013, which gave news of the main events affecting the Group and individual banks and companies in the period from March 2012 to March 2013. The publication was distributed not only to all employees of the UBI Banca Group, but also to registered shareholders who attended the UBI Banca Annual General Meeting. At the end of the year the “Quality Quality Mission Convention” Convention was held to analyse the main developments and projects carried forward by the Group during the year, with a glance also at prospects for 2014. Over 2,000 staff from all companies in the Group took part. LA11 Although in a difficult context, with significant attention paid to costs, the UBI Group has continued PROGRAMS ROGRAMS FOR SKILL to invest in the development and motivation of human resources, in the conviction that MANAGEMENT AND encouraging professional growth is a guarantee of the intellectual and human capital capable of LIFE-LONG LEARNING generating competitive advantages and ensuring that Group results are stable and solid over time. More specifically, with the general objective of generating concrete and measurable value both for the individual and for the Group, a programme was commenced during the year which places people at the centre of the Bank’s strategy by using the following levers: knowledge of their characteristics and potential; the most efficient allocation of staff in terms of market requirements; the growth of staff by means of feedback and a more incisive performance assessment process; motivation of staff as a consequence of development processes based on merit and transparency. The main lines of this project included the following: initiatives to increase excellence behaviours among human resource managers; putting a structured and centralised programme of growth in place for the most talented staff; a proposal for a new approach to mobility as an opportunity by creating dedicated units and paths; a review of the headquarters-distribution network management model; and a review of the entire performance management system. Due to its complexity and the profound underlying renewal involved, this last part of the project will become operational in 2014 by unifying the Performance Assessment and Skill Measurement units because it was decided not to go ahead with it in 2013 in order to move towards a new system of professional assessment. Activity continued to measure management skills and to obtain the relative feedback (management appraisal) for the purposes of the proper management of key Group positions and selection of the best managers and a model of internal wage brackets and external wage references was also consolidated, both effective instruments for human resource selection, development, management and mobility. During the year the “JobJob Posting Posting” osting tool (an online window of jobs available which allows staff who may be interested to send in applications) was fully rolled out for use by all Group banks and companies, with a view to enhancing internal professionalism through intra group mobility. 85 Social Report 2013 Labour practices and decent work LA12 In almost all Group companies (for a total of 17,547 employees), all employees, with the sole PERCENTAGE OF exception of members of General Management, are involved in a Performance Assessment Assessment process, EMPLOYEES i.e. an assessment of the contribution made to achieving company results. RECEIVING REGULAR PERFORMANCE AND Performance assessment, together with all other human resource management tools, represents an CAREER important and indispensible pool of information which supports personnel management units to DEVELOPMENT plan the career development of all workers. The performance objectives that are set for workers REVIEWS are divided into result objectives (usually operating and project objectives) and skill objectives (capabilities and role knowledge assessed during skill assessment processes). Result objectives and the knowledge requested (which forms part of the skill objectives) in the assessment of managers vary on the basis of the position occupied, while the capabilities required are the same for all. The latter concern risk taking and decision making, the formulation of plans and strategies, human resource management, the management of uncertainties and difficulties and agreement and negotiation skills. The performance assessment process takes place in three stages each year – planning the expected performance, intermediate verifications and final assessment – and it involves various parties who are in continuous contact with each other: the manager-assessor (who communicates team objectives, sets individual performance objectives for each worker, supervises them throughout the process and assesses the results achieved); the second level supervisor (who supervises the assessment process and verifies the consistency of the results at the level of the organisational unit); and the workers (who take an active part in all stages of the assessment, furnishing suggestions for the success of the process. Workers express their degree of agreement with the assessment received and they verify the achievement of their objectives in person, themselves). All managers are required to carry out performance assessments of their workers. 2013 2012 2011 1 PERF O RMAN CE ASSESSMEN T EMPLO Y EES EMPL O Y EES EMPLO Y EES PARTICIPAN TS PAR TICIPAN TS PARTICIPAN TS IN VO L V ED IN V O L VED IN VO L V ED Middle managers 7,131 99.2% 6,850 96.1% 7,368 98.0% 7,239 98.2% 7,228 98.6% 6,947 96.1% of which women 1,614 98.5% 1,521 94.2% 1,610 97.8% 1,576 97.9% 1,559 97.9% 1,470 94.3% Professional areas 10,416 98.4% 9,967 95.7% 10,651 96.6% 10,546 99.0% 10,845 96.3% 10,322 95.2% of which women 4,964 97.8% 4,711 94.9% 5,031 96.0% 4,971 98.8% 5,137 96.7% 4,802 93.5% TO TAL 1 7 ,5 4 7 9 8 .8 % 1 6 ,8 1 7 9 5 .8 % 1 8 ,0 1 9 9 7 .1 % 1 7 ,7 8 5 9 8 .7 % 1 8 ,0 7 3 9 7 .2 % 1 7 ,2 6 9 9 5 .6 % of w h ic h w omen 6 ,5 7 8 9 8 .0 % 6 ,2 3 2 9 4 .7 % 6 ,6 4 1 9 6 .3 % 6 ,5 4 7 9 8 .6 % 6 ,6 9 6 9 5 .9 % 6 ,2 7 2 9 3 .7 % 1 Performance assessment for senior management personnel was part of the relative incentive scheme.

The information as a whole is then assessed and set within the broader corporate framework to obtain an overall vision which ensures fair, consistent and professionally valid management for all Group personnel. For some corporate figures (above all in the distribution network) career progressions are governed by agreements entered into with trade unions on job gradings.

Human rights UBI Banca is maintaining its commitment entered into in 2003 by the former BPU Banca, to support and promote, within its sphere of influence, the universal principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights and in particular the right to personal integrity and dignity and the right to individual and collective health and safety in accordance with the provisions of the Group Code of Ethics. This commitment is implemented in various areas of the Group’s activity and in its relations with its various stakeholders as much through activities performed by control functions and risk management and compliance functions in particular with regard to money-laundering and the fight against terrorism as through the quality of its business processes and in detail: • policies and procedures to manage personnel in compliance with Italian law and with the main international standards; • ethical standards in contracts with suppliers; • credit and commercial policies attentive to the needs of the socially vulnerable, with particular attention paid to the issue of financial inclusion and the prevention of over indebtedness and the risks connected with involvement in particular economic sectors and in the arms sector above all; • support for social organisations that work for the promotion and protection of individuals through action in the fields of health, welfare and humanitarian assistance. LA, FS1, FS2, FS7 and EC8 Investment and procurement practices HR1 The UBI Banca Group operates almost exclusively in Italy, where the laws ensure a high standard of INVESTMENT respect for and protection of human rights.

FS4 89 Social Report 2013 Human rights Non discrimination discrimination HR4 The Code of Ethics expressly provides for respect for the principle of equality and nonnonINCIDENTS OF discrimination and therefore conduct is not admissible which might cause harm to the integrity and DISCRIMINATION AND dignity of persons, nor is discrimination based on preferences or arbitrary exclusion (i.e. not linked ACTIONS TAKEN to the importance of the contribution that a relationship with a party may offer or the interest that the party may represent for the achievement of the Group’s mission). Again in 2013, as in previous years, no reports of violation of the Code of Ethics were received for cases of discrimination against personnel or other stakeholders. Because the principle of nondiscrimination is considered particularly important in employment relations, UBI Banca has adopted specific guidelines for disciplinary procedures which: • set out official investigation, decision-making and judgement processes which subsidiaries must follow for the more serious cases of contestations and disciplinary provisions for reprimands; • provide unequivocal recommendations to the body which must decide sanctions in relation to the type of provision and the position of the employee subject to sanction; • defines information which companies must report periodically to the Parent for full visibility of disciplinary procedures taken by the Group. All the Group companies inform the Parent of the start of disciplinary procedures and the Parent monitors all procedures providing advice where requested and also assistance in drafting the contestation, examining the justifications and proposing the sanctions if applicable to be imposed to the companies. Companies are also required to report all litigation the nature of which could be of importance for the entire Group and the Parent provides advice whenever requested by companies, with support in investigating the case, attendance at meetings with outside advisors to formulate strategies and represent companies at hearings before judges. In 2013 65 disciplinary measures (30 less than in 2012) were adopted due to operational irregularities and negligence of various kinds (43), to irregularities in the disbursement and management of loans (13) and improper appropriation/diversion of funds administered (9).

[ FS8] COMMUNITIES SO10 PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES Corruption Corruption UBI Banca provides full co-operation with the authorities in the fight against moneymoney-laundering and finance for terrorism by making adequate resources and tools available for the prompt performance of the operations requested in observance with the legislation and regulations in force. Oversight of these issues is performed centrally in the Group and is carried out by a special organisational unit, the AntiAnti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Finance Area,Area which reports to the Chief Risk Officer – and is based on following: • an effective and efficient IT system, which uses various software applications (e.g. Gianos and internally developed applications) to manage customer risk profiles and to monitor all transactions (according to the amount limits set by the relative legislation); • clear, exhaustive and easy-to-use internal regulations, systematically aligned with legislative regulations; • precise regulations for the acquisition and conservation of documents to identify customers, to view their financial profiles and to perform accounting and all other operations in full compliance with civil law regulations and anti money-laundering legislation. In order to ensure effective oversight, independent information (lists) is acquired from reliable and independent sources on terrorists and persons politically exposed and special IT procedures have been developed or acquired from major software houses, which support adequate controls of customers and complete and accurate recording of transactions and accounts and reporting of suspect transactions in the “Single IT Archive”. All transactions – with the amount limits set by the relative legislation – are subject to monitoring by IT software applications to identify activities suspected of being connected with moneylaundering or other illegal activities. These are subsequently assessed by line and/or control functions. In 2013 new software applications were developed and organisational controls were improved to promptly detect transactions and customer relationships that present a potential risk or which do not conform with the relative regulations. More specifically, Group policies (Strategic Orientations and Group Regulations on Anti Money-Laundering), regulations, processes and procedures were rd updated and reviewed in light of the Bank of Italy Provisions of 3 April 2013 on the subject st “Adequate Verification and Keeping a Single IT Archive” (which came into force on the 1 January 2014). At the same time a training programme was continued to improve staff culture and awareness on the matter and to provide knowledge of the new developments introduced by the above mentioned provisions. SO2 As already programmed the training commitment will continue in 2014 with the same intensity and BUSINESS UNITS a budget has been allocated to further improve and refine anti-money-laundering systems and ANALYSED FOR oversigh CORRUPTION RISKS 2.5, LA10, FS7 93 Social report 2013 Society By signing the Global Compact, the Group has committed itself to fighting all types of corruption within the sphere of its responsibilities. This crime is also contemplated in Italy as a “predicate offence” falling within the sphere of Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 on the administrative liability of businesses in implementation of which UBI Banca has adopted a model of organisation, management and control (Model 231/2001), which provides (i) for rules and procedures designed to prevent the crimes covered by the decree from being committed, (ii) for the creation of a Supervisory Body to ensure the proper functioning and (iii) for constant updating of the Model and reporting and penalty systems. In 2013 oversight regulations to prevent the commission of the crimes contemplated by the UBI Banca 231/2001 model were updated, with regard, amongst other things, to preventing the crime of corruption, in relation to amendments to the law and new crimes introduced by Law No. 190/2012 (the “Anti-Corruption Law”). Of particular importance among these, apart from the new crime pursuant to ’Art. 319 – quater of the Italian Criminal Code (improper incitement to give or promised profit), is the new crime of corruption between individuals (Art. 2635 of the Italian Civil Code). All activities and organisational units are subject to verification connected with implementation of the Model, while the Supervisory Body reports to the governing bodies on its adoption and effective implementation, the supervision of its functioning and oversight of its update. In compliance with the provisions of new regulations introduced by Law No. 183/2011 and with the provisions of Bank th nd of Italy Circular No. 263 (15 update of 2 July 2013), in 2013 UBI Banca identified its Supervisory Body as a collegial body with the same composition as that of UBI Banca’s Internal Control Committee formed in accordance with article 49 of the Articles Association internal to the Supervisory Board. UBI Banca, as the Parent of the Group, informs subsidiaries of the policies it has set in relation to the prevention of crimes pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 and recommends general criteria which subsidiaries may follow. Each subsidiary adopts its own Organisational, Management and Control Model with the same characteristics of those reported above, which is periodically updated with support from the Parent. The Internal Audit Function carries out auditing activity on UBI Banca on subsidiaries who have delegated internal audit function activities to the Parent and more generally, as part of the management and control duties of the Parent, on all Group companies. With regard to that auditing perimeter, in compliance with international professional standards, the Internal Audit function also carries out on-site inspections of the operation and the appropriateness of the internal control and risk management system by means of an annual plan of activities submitted to the management and supervisory bodies of the above-mentioned subsidiaries and cumulatively to the management and supervisory bodies of the Parent. In compliance with the policies set and with the relative regulations, the Internal Audit Function audited the completeness, adequacy, functioning and reliability of the other components of the control systems, the risk management process and other processes, with regard also to the ability to identify errors and irregularities. More specifically, in consideration of the need to support the Supervisory Board in the performance of its duties under legislation and regulations, and also to assist the Management Board, the Internal Audit Function, in relation to their importance, identified organisational units and processes affected by the impact of regulations concerning risk management (business, operational and compliance risk) and it also gave advisory support to project activities that impacted the internal control system and it verified through specific analyses of the system, the reliability of IT systems employed in the accounting records systems. In this respect the function carried out inspections of the organisational units of the Parent and its subsidiaries in relation to compliance by the relative staff, with external and corporate regulations including the Code of Ethics, to which the 231/2001 Model makes reference, and the related Code of Conduct for group personnel. 94 Social report 2013 Society SO3 All employees are trained in anti-corruption policies and procedures as part of their training to EMPLOYEES TRAINED implement the project to revise the anti money-laundering model. In 2013 25,631 hours of specific ON ANTItraining was carried out both in the classroom and through the e-learning platform, with the CORRUPTION involvement of 13,738 employees. Anti corruption policies and procedures were then addressed as POLICIES AND part of training on the principles derived from Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, delivered to 290 PROCEDURES employees for a total of approximately 828 hours. The training procedures differed according to the LA10 level of responsibility. SO4 No cases of corruption regarding Group personnel occurred either in 2013 or in prior years. ACTIONS TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO INCIDENTS OF CORRUPTION Public policies SO5 The Group contributes to the development of public policies through its active and constructive PUBLIC POLICY participation in the initiatives of trade associations (e.g. Italian Banking Association, National DEVELOPMENT AND Association of “Popular Banks”, Italian Private Banking Association, Associazione fra le Società LOBBYING ACTIVITY italiane per Azioni – association of joint stock companies – Italian Association of Financial Analysts, etc.) and other associations active in specific areas (Italian Anti Money-Laundering Association), which express the position of the sector on issues of interest, both on the request of the authorities (e.g. the Bank of Italy) and political decision-makers (e.g. Parliamentary Commissions) and by taking own initiatives. UBI Banca is a member of the Italian Advisory Board of the G8 Task Force on social investment. Its purpose is to promote the development of a finance model able to generate not only profit, but at the same time also social and environmental value and the development of tools to measure the social impacts of the investments. SO6 In compliance with the Code of Ethics, no payments – neither direct nor indirect and in any form – CONTRIBUTIONS TO are made within the Group to political parties, movements, committees and other political PARTIES, POLITICAL PARTIES organisations, their representatives and candidates, congresses or festivals having political POLITICIANS AND propaganda purposes.

Product responsibility Product responsibility in the financial services sector mainly regards observance of customer interests in commercial and marketing practices, the development of products and services capable of generating high social benefits for local communities and support for economic activities which create value for the community. Code of Ethics p. 22-23 Respect for the interests of customers is assessed from the viewpoint of the following: security (in terms of both business continuity and physical security in branches); labelling of products and services (in the sense of providing customers with transparent information); marketing communications (above all in terms of the proposals being appropriate to customer needs and profiles and the appropriateness of the commercial contact), respect for privacy (from the viewpoint both of protecting IT systems from data loss or unauthorised access to data and respect for customer consent for processing personal data for commercial and marketing purposes) and, more generally, compliance with legislation and regulations – including voluntary codes of conduct – which govern the sale and use of products and services. In Italy, all these aspects are governed by specific laws and sector regulations, which the Group applies through its own internal regulations. They are communicated to all personnel by means of a dedicated intranet and are the subject of specific refresher courses. Implementation of these regulations occurs through the following organisational and technical controls: • the Chief Business Officer is responsible for organisational controls of operating activities and first level controls and the Chief Risk Officer (the Compliance Function in particular) and the Chief Audit Officer are responsible for second level controls; • technical controls consist of dedicated support platforms for commercial activities (e.g. identification of customers to which determined products and services should be offered on the basis of an analysis of their life cycle and behavioural profile and therefore of their possible unsatisfied financial necessities) and of protection tools on IT systems. FS15 The Group has a specific process in place for the development of new products and services and for POLICIES FOR THE the modification of those already marketed by the network banks (including UBI Banca Private FAIR DESIGN AND Investment) and by the Parent, with the exception of products and services for which specific SALE OF FINANCIAL regulations apply or are currently being issued (e.g. subsidised loans). This process is designed to PRODUCTS AND help achieve objectives of quality, technological innovation, competitiveness and compliance SERVICES objectives. In terms of quality, quality the process is designed to ensure that products and services are consistent with the relative customer characteristics and needs and with reducing the time taken to respond to market demands (time-to-market) and it requires the involvement of different organisational units some of which at the Parent must always be involved: Communication and Marketing, Legal Affairs and Litigation, Risk Management, Administration and Tax, Compliance. Corporate functions responsible for compliance oversight are responsible for preventing any misalignments between internal regulations, the most important of which is the Group’s Code of Ethics, and external regulations. The characteristics (e.g. age, occupation, investment plans) and needs of customers (e.g. financial, protection) are surveyed both through special consultation and interview procedures (e.g. focus groups with customers and potential customers and with commercial distribution network staff) or systematic procedures (e.g. the customer satisfaction survey project or complaints management [ PR5]) and through the analysis of competitor’s products and services. Active participation in observatories and working groups (e.g. through the Italian Banking Association) or research centre initiatives are also the source of valuable information, for example in relation to the possibilities offered by new technologies. 96 Social Report 2013 Product responsibility Technological innovation is pursued mainly at MultiMulti-channel Bank Bank level [ 2.5]. Product innovation takes account of market best practices and the evolution of technology and the relative new possibilities in the field of banking and financial services. Each month requests received from staff through the corporate intranet and from customers by means of website contact forms, emails and the customer service are analysed to assess feasibility and to plan the development of improvements. Competitiveness is based on a pricing policy oriented towards transparency and fairness to customers and it involves analysis and constant monitoring of the relationships between the risk taken (if present), the return, the costs incurred and the market context, with account taken of the need to provide financial support to local communities and businesses. The Pricing Excellence Excellence project commenced in 2011 was further implemented and consolidated in 2013. It is designed to achieve (i) higher revenues and greater customer satisfaction at the same time through better management of prices by commercial units at the Parent and network banks, (ii) savings in time and therefore shorter response times and also greater flexibility in the range of products and services through operational streamlining and (iii) lower operating risks and respect for regulatory and compliance issues, through improved operational instruments, monitoring process quality and greater automation and integration of information. FS16 The possession of proficient economic and financial expertise helps to create citizens INITIATIVES TO knowledgeable in their choice of banking financial products and services, which increases ENHANCE FINANCIAL economic democracy and legality and makes local businesses and economies and the Bank itself LITERACY more competitive. UBI Banca is aware of this and in playing its role as a bank in local communities, it has built relationships over the years and forms of co-operation with schools, training institutes and universities. Activities in schools The Group continued in 2013 with its commitment to teaching on economics and financial subjects in schools, by making specific professional resources available, in the form of tutors, as part of financial training and educational programmes organised by the PattiChiari Consortium. Consortium The significant contribution made by the Group’s network banks constitutes a concrete response to the growing demand for financial education from the world of schools and is also a way of developing an increasingly more open relationship with the communities in which the Group operates. The Group’s commitment for the academic year 2012-2013 is focused on three educational programmes that are now well established, up-to-date and enhanced by the PattiChiari Consortium, partly as a result of the support from academics and communication experts as follows: for primary school children, a programmed to stimulate initial thinking about the value of money and the need to manage it responsibly, for oneself and for the community, with a view to knowledgeable citizenship; a programme to introduce secondary school pupils to economic and financial subjects and to stimulate them to reflect on the principal functions of finance, by illustrating their impact on people’s everyday lives; a programme to study economics and financial subjects, by introducing upper secondary school children to the social, professional and economic reality that surrounds them. At the end of the course, taught in the classroom, the project involves a “Develop your business idea” competition, with the preparation of a business plan for the start-up of a socially useful enterprise in the local community. 97 Social Report 2013 Product responsibility 1 A questionnaire was produced during the year, in co-operation with Invalsi and with the active participation of the network banks of the Group, to assess the effectiveness of the PattiChiari programmes in schools, the results of which confirmed the usefulness of the training activity. In addition to delivering lessons in the classroom, Group banks, again as part of the PattiChiari Consortium, contributed to the organisation of further financial education events in the community targeted both at pupils and students (e.g. open days, financial education weeks, local prizes for the competition “Develop your business idea”) and also for other members of society (e.g. training meetings for teachers and families). Significant growth in the activities organised by PattiChiari with the support of banks who are members of the consortium led again in 2013 to the signing of new memorandums of intent for cooperation with national and local institutions and to numerous partnership agreements with private sector entities and with institutions for the dissemination of financial education. In this context significant co-operation projects were launched by the Group with the PattiChiari Consortium and with FIDAE (Federation of Educational Institutes) an umbrella organisation for around 2,500 primary and secondary Catholic schools. During the year Group banks organised and participated in other financial education and economic citizenship initiatives and events organised in different Italian towns and cities both with and without the co-operation of the PattiChiari Consortium. More specifically, for the third consecutive year Banca Carime held mini conferences in co-operation with a leading regional newspaper on the subject of saving and on the causes of the economic crisis (approximately 350 students were involved from seven lower and upper secondary schools in Apulia).

The Group supports the “World Campus” programme with the University of Ancona, launched to support and disseminate technological innovation and training for university students through internships abroad. Co-operation with research centres includes the now well established relationships with the Einaudi Study Centre for the preparation of the Annual Report on the Global Economy and Italy, with the Italian Association for Research into Cancer (AIRC), (AIRC) with the Research Foundation of the Ospedale Maggiore Hospital in Bergamo and with the Mario Negri Pharmacological research research Institute (IRCCS) (IRCCS) to promote and finance scientific research of particular social interest. Two important scholarships have been assigned to the San Martino hospital of Genoa to support haematological research. Organisation of events Each year the Parent and the network banks organise training and educational events on topical economic subjects, which represent important opportunities in terms of visibility and involvement, as well as providing a service to customers and to society in general.
