United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress Covering Calendar Year 2013 9th April 2014 To our Stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that once again this year AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. ( AMG ) reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and AntiCorruption. Our Code of Business Conduct and Policy on Human Rights, both of which are available on our website, set out our commitments to act ethically and uphold the ten UNGC principles in all of our business activities. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication, primarily the AMG website www.amg-nv.com. Sincerely yours, Dr. Heinz C. Schimmelbusch Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 20140409 Communication on Progress 1 HUMAN RIGHTS  Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group continues to explicitly supports the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our commitment in this area began in 2009 with the publication of our Code of Business Conduct and was augmented in 2011 with the publication of our Policy on Human Rights. Both of these documents can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the AMG website, and the Human Rights Policy is shown below: 20140409 Communication on Progress 2 The commitments made in these publications are monitored by a network of Compliance Officers under the oversight of a Chief Compliance Officer – a new role created within AMG – and their team. Further this team is continually supported by senior management across the subsidiary companies. Regular training is provided to support this group. This team has developed Compliance training for AMG staff at all levels in the organization. In 2013 there were no reported incidents of breaches of the AMG Code of Business Conduct, and in particular none related to human rights abuses.  Principle 2 Make sure businesses are not complicit in human rights abuses The aim of the presence of an AMG business unit in a community is to strengthen and be part of the community, fostering sound relationships and avoiding conflicts. We respect the dignity and rights of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate and others who might be affected by our operations and actively involving ourselves and supporting those communities. AMG sustains an expanding network of Code of Business Conduct Compliance Officers based in the countries and major sites where AMG companies are operating. Additionally, AMG has had a Whistle blowing policy in force since 2009 allowing employees to come forward on a confidential basis to report issues. The Whistleblowing policy can be accessed through the Governance section of the AMG website. In 2012 no reports of incidents have been filed through the Whistle blowing policy mechanism. Further, in 2013 AMG developed and implemented its Supplier Conduct Charter, shown below. This is the start of a process to ensure the standards relating to Human Rights which AMG holds itself to, are expanded to our suppliers as well. In particular, this policy states that: “AMG’s suppliers should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure they are not complicit in human rights abuses.” 20140409 Communication on Progress 3 LABOR  Principle 3 Businesses should uphold freedom of association & effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees to join, or choose not to join, legally authorized association or organizations. AMG continues to use the Global Reporting Initiative 20140409 Communication on Progress 4 (GRI) indicator LA4 (Percentage of Employees Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements) to monitor this principle. In our 2013 Annual Report we state: “AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees and their rights to join, or to choose not to join, unions. Across the Company, 2,098 AMG employees (68%) were covered by collective bargaining agreements. 72% of AMG Processing and 86% of AMG Mining employees are covered by such arrangements. AMG Engineering, which includes a higher proportion of professional salaried staff, has 45% of its employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. There were no strikes or lockouts reported at any of AMG’s facilities in 2013.” Additionally, we utilize indicator HR5 (Operations Identified in which the right to exercise freedom of association or collective bargaining may be at significant risk, and actions taken to support these rights). In the 2013 Annual Report we state: “Each AMG site is assessed during site visits and internal audits to identify if there is the possibility of freedom of association or collective bargaining being put at risk because of political or business factors. In 2013, it was found that no sites were at risk, with the exception of China, where the formation of unions remains restricted.” Further, with the development and implementation of our Supplier Conduct Charter we begin to hold our suppliers to the same standard stating: “AMG’s suppliers should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor”  Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor All AMG employees work for the company as a result of need or want. Nobody is forced to work for AMG and we prohibit the use of any forced labor, including slavery, servitude, or prison labor. This is reflected in the widespread presence of unionized labor across AMG. Currently most of the locations and environments AMG facilities are present in are stable and advanced democracies, assisting in ensuring human rights abuses of this type are not occurring. Again, our Supplier Conduct Charter adopted in 2013 introduces our commitment to this principal to our suppliers stating: “AMG’s suppliers should support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor.”  Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labor As stated in our Human Rights Policy, AMG does not employ children and strongly rejects the use of child labor, and expects our suppliers to do the same through the requirements of our Supplier Conduct Charter. AMG does actively support the creation of educational programs for young people including apprenticeships combined with formal education, particularly in the areas of science and engineering. In our annual report we utilize the Global Reporting Initiative indicator HR6 “Operations identified as having significant risk for incidents of child labor, and measure taken to contribute to the elimination of child labor”. In its most recent annual report AMG reported that it has reviewed 36 of its operating sites across the world to ensure that they 20140409 Communication on Progress 5 are not at risk for employing child labor or exposing young workers to hazards. It was found that no sites posed a risk at this time. AMG is at the root of the supply chain for several of its products and is proud to be able to supply metals such as Tantalum and Tin, commodities historically fraught with human rights abuses, from mining operations with strong ethical practices and not utilizing child labor. In particular our Tantalum supply chain in Brazil is certified as Conflict Free by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC).  Principle 6 Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation AMG’s Code of Business Conduct states that the Company views as unacceptable any form of harassment or unfair or unlawful discrimination based on race, age, gender, color, sexual orientation, disability or national origin, whether by employees, temporary employees, managers, customers, vendors or AMG companies’ visitors. At year-end 2013, AMG Processing had a workforce of 1,301, AMG Engineering had 879 employees, and AMG Mining had 854 employees. For those facilities reporting here, including corporate staff (39), the total AMG workforce was 3,073 (facilities not yet covered in this section employ a further 20 people). Geographically, these were located in Asia (10%), Europe (57%), North America (17%) and South America (16%). A further 327 directly supervised contract workers were employed at AMG sites. AMG assesses the diversity of its workforce in terms of gender and age. The multinational, and therefore multicultural, nature of the business means that ethnic diversity is significant, but because of the difficulty in defining minority employees in such an environment, the Company does not collect data on this aspect. Of the total employees, 19% are female; 19% are under 30 years of age, 53% between 30 and 50, and 28% over 50. The Management Board is 66% male and 33% female. The Supervisory Board is 87% male and 13% female. One Supervisory Board member is aged 30-50 while seven are over 50. The commitments made in 2012 have made progress with increased gender diversity in the management board (moving from all male to 33% female) and the supervisory board (moving from all male to 13% female). However, AMG is continuing to work to improve the diversity of its Boards. On page 40 of our 2013 Annual Report we note: “Gender Diversity: The Supervisory Board recognizes the importance of a diverse composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board in terms of gender. The Supervisory Board is pleased that in 2013, Ms. Ute Wolf has joined the Supervisory Board and that Ms. Amy Ard has been appointed as Chief Financial Officer New Dutch legislation that became effective on January 1, 2013, requires the Company to pursue a policy of having at least 30% of the seats on the Supervisory Board and the Management Board be held by men and at least 30% of the seats be held by women. The Company will continue to take this allocation of seats into account in connection with the following actions: (1) the appointment or nomination for the appointment of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board and (2) drafting the criteria for the size and 20140409 Communication on Progress 6 composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board. At this moment, the Company does comply with article 2:166 Dutch Civil Code as regards the composition of the Management Board, and does not fully comply with this article as regards the composition of the Supervisory Board where currently only 12.5% of the Supervisory Board seats are held by women which will increase to 22% once the general meeting of shareholders approves the nomination of Ms. Ceccarelli. The Supervisory Board will continue to look for suitable female candidates for the Supervisory Board.” ENVIRONMENT  Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges All AMG facilities have a strong awareness and knowledge of their environmental impact and the company utilizes the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 guidelines to measure and report environmental impacts in a number of areas including raw material use, energy consumption, greenhouse gas generation, water use and discharge and waste generation and disposal. These are reported annually to our stakeholders in the Company annual report. Many of AMG’s activities focus on technologies to address fossil fuel efficiencies and reduce greenhouse gas generation, where we believe a precautionary approach is vital given the potential adverse effects. Many of the technologies that AMG produces, which we refer to as “enabling technologies” contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation and buildings sectors. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Several of the larger AMG manufacturing facilities either have ISO 14001 environmental management system certification in place. Formalized management systems are seen as a key tool to maintaining focus on environmental responsibility. Additionally AMG has invested in projects including hydroelectric generation, solar generation and heat recovery systems. It is also promoting energy management initiatives to improve efficiencies. AMG has also been a key player in the disassembly of the US and Russian nuclear arsenals under international treaties through the design of plants in the USA to convert weapons grade nuclear materials into materials for peaceful nuclear fuel generating applications with associated social and environmental benefits to society as a whole. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP). 20140409 Communication on Progress 7  Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies AMG’s businesses continue to focus on environmentally friendly technologies. We have expanded our supply chain for lightweight aluminum and titanium alloying materials through the integration of AMG Aluminum, further strengthening our commitment to these technologies. We have also invested heavily in our plant in Cambridge, Ohio that produces the steel strengthening alloy ferrovanadium from byproducts of the oil refining and power generation industries, eliminating landfill. This technology reduces energy in the manufacturing process and by strengthening steel, significantly reduces the tonnages required in end user applications. AMG is also actively supporting the automotive industry as it moves to more fuel efficient turbo charged, low displacement engines, through applications of materials such as gamma titanium aluminide and heat treatment of fast moving, high temperature parts such as turbo chargers and piston heads. Similar applications have been seen in next generation aviation jet engines which contribute to the fuel efficiency of next generation aircraft and where AMG’s ceramic coating technologies further enable fuel efficiency savings. AMG continues to believe that nuclear power is required as part of the short and medium term solution to anthropogenic CO2 emissions and continue to supply products and engineering expertise to support this sector. ANTI CORRUPTION  Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. In 2009 AMG introduced (and published) its Code of Business Conduct to all of its staff which sets out guiding principles in its ethics and business conduct as adopted and approved by the Company’s Management Board and Supervisory Board. The Code of Business Conduct discusses in detail the ethical conduct and business practices which AMG expects from all employees, covering area’s like conflicts of interest, anti-bribery, insider dealing, policies on corporate entertainment and acceptance of gifts, and the integrity of our record keeping and reporting. Additionally in 2012, AMG published its stand-alone policy on Anti-bribery and Anticorruption. This is available under the Corporate Governance section of the AMG-NV website. Specific training programs for staff, using web based training, and compliance officers, via face to face training, has been carried out and further training will take place in 2014. In 2013 AMG further promoted these values throughout the Company with a multi lingual poster campaign to raise awareness of the Code of Business Conduct and various ethically based programs. 20140409 Communication on Progress 8 20140409 Communication on Progress 9 ATTACHMENT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SECTION FROM THE 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS 20140409 Communication on Progress 10 Sustainable Development SITE NAME LOCATION COUNTRY DIVISION AMG Headquarters Amsterdam Netherlands AMG Corporate AMG USA Headquarters Pennsylvania USA AMG Corporate ALD IMP Berlin Germany AMG Engineering AMG Intellifast Speyer Germany AMG Engineering ALD USA Connecticut USA AMG Engineering ALD TIV Grenoble France AMG Engineering ALD UK Guildford UK AMG Engineering ALD FNAG Hanau Germany AMG Engineering ALD Vacuum Technologies1 Hanau Germany AMG Engineering ALD Vacuheat1 Limbach Germany AMG Engineering ALD TT USA1 Michigan USA AMG Engineering ALD Dynatech Mumbai India AMG Engineering ALD TT Mexico1 Ramos Arizpe Mexico AMG Engineering ALD Japan Shinjuku-ku Japan AMG Engineering ALD Singapore Singapore Singapore AMG Engineering ALD C&K Suzhou China AMG Engineering AMG Mining Edelgraphit Bonn Germany AMG Mining AMG Antimony Chauny France AMG Mining Bogala Graphite Lanka1 Colombo Sri Lanka AMG Mining AMG Mining1 Kropfmuhl Germany AMG Mining AMG Antimony Lucette France AMG Mining AMG Mineração1 Nazareno Brazil AMG Mining AMG Silicon1 Pocking Germany AMG Mining AMG Graphite Qingdao China AMG Mining AMG Graphite Tyn Tyn Czech Republic AMG Mining AMG Alpoco Anglesey UK AMG Processing AMG Titanium Alloys and Coatings1 Brand Erbisdorf Germany AMG Processing AMG Aluminum Jiaxing China AMG Processing AMG Aluminum Kentucky USA AMG Processing AMG Alpoco Minworth UK AMG Processing AMG Titanium Alloys and Coatings1 Nürnberg Germany AMG Processing AMG Vanadium1 Ohio USA AMG Processing AMG Aluminum Pennsylvania USA AMG Processing AMG Superalloys and AMG Aluminum1 Rotherham UK AMG Processing AMG Superalloys1 Sao Joao del Rei Brazil AMG Processing AMG Aluminum Washington USA AMG Processing Notes: The chart indicates which facilities were included in the scope of the sustainable development data.

Across AMG, the split between renewable and non-renewable indirect energy sources is difficult to determine since Climate Change utilities do not generally publish this information (with some GRI INDICATOR EN 16 exceptions; e.g. CEMIG in Brazil now produces this data). AMG facilities utilize processes that are associated with both However, AMG does generate its own renewable energy. direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and both In 2013, AMG’s upgraded hydroelectric generating facility types are reported here. Electricity used for the generation near São João del Rei, Brazil operated for the full year and of heat for metallurgical processing has been, and remains, generated 48,500 GJ (13,500 MWh). This supplied AMG’s local the most significant source of GHG emissions for AMG.
