As our business is guided and shaped by our eight strategic imperatives, the discussions and disclosures in our Annual Report too once again pivot around them. As such, Highlights of the Year, Management Report, Enterprise Governance Report and Risk Management Report illustrate and discuss our position and response in holding true to these eight strategic imperatives. As much as this is a Report about Dimo’s duties of responsible trusteeship, faithful stewardship and uncompromising accountability, it is also a Report of Dimo’s drivers of value; or as we call it a Report of Dimo’s financial capital and non financial capital. As in the past, this year too, we have published our Annual Report in a web friendly HTML format. However, this year, we have made an important change. The Report in your hands has been presented in a manner that highlights the most important discussions and disclosures without diluting them in too much detail. Full details, for those who require them, are contained in the web version. In the same token, we have recognised the growing popularity of mobile devices and have presented a highly abridged version for those accessing our Annual Report from a smart phone.

We exist because we (1) Refine the portfolio mix of our business continuously (2) Create financial value (3) Earn the trust of customers and they keep coming back (4) Nurture people and they find it enjoyable and rewarding to work with us (5) Have great relationships with best-of-breed business partners (6) Play by the rules (7) Serve the community (8) Are friendly towards the environment. And these constitute our eight strategic imperatives. 5 Context DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 A 360-Degree View of Highlights of the Year Report Approach…Setting Tone and Tenor Chairman’s Letter Chief Executive Officer’s Review A 360-Degree View of Highlights of the Year Key Performance Area Metric 2012/13 2011/12 2010/11 2009/10 Refining the Portfolio Mix of Our Business Continuously Portfolio diversification Non-auto segment as a percentage of total turnover 17.00 12.40 19.47 35.16 Creating Financial Value Wealth creation Economic value added (Rs. mn) (547) 1,905 1,762 55 Market value added (Rs. mn) (3,149) 1,253 8,719 1,495 Net asset value per share (Rs.) 860 841 473 253 Market capitalisation (Rs. mn) 4,483 8,718 12,920 3,696 Shareholder return Return on equity (%) 6.06 36.13 50.51 11.20 Earnings per share (Rs.) 52.06 303.87 239.03 27.97 Price earnings ratio (times) 9.7 3.2 6.2 15.2 Dividend per share (Rs.) 10 40 61 7 Shareholders’ funds (Rs. mn) at the year end 7,631 7,465 4,201 2,200 Earning the Trust of Customers So That They Keep Coming Back Customer convenience No. of customer interaction points 52 40 25 19 Customer satisfaction Average customer satisfaction index (%) 85.50 89.20 85.60 82.60 Nurturing People So That They Find It Enjoyable and Rewarding to Work with Us Employee satisfaction Employee satisfaction index (%) 53.46 62.70 54.00 54.00 Employee turnover ratio (%) 21.81 21.10 19.30 14.20 No. of employees in service for over 5 years 489 428 386 372 Knowledge and skills development Total no. of training hours 24,336 18,106 11,107 8,936 Having Great Relationships with Best-of-Breed Business Partners Relationship with principals No. of principals 81 78 72 63 Length of the longest relationship (years) 74 73 72 71 Playing by the Rules Contribution to exchequer Tax paid to Government (Rs. mn) 2,972 6,062 5,571 1,520 Serving the Community Investing in community Community development investments (Rs. mn) 50.8 51.1 30.0 5.9 Community investments as percentage of turnover (%) 0.19 0.14 0.10 0.10 Development of youth No. of vocational trainees enrolled 154 168 148 N/A Being Friendly Towards the Environment Combating climate change Total carbon footprint (Tons) 6,312 6,779 3,192 2,604 Carbon footprint tCO2 e per Rs. 1 mn of Group net turnover 0.2292 0.1674 0.1064 0.2472 6 Context Report Approach…Setting Tone and Tenor Overview We continue with the trend of integrated reporting as we have done in our last two Annual Reports. The value that the Company delivers to its constituent stakeholders and the value of those stakeholders to the Company in driving its future earnings are considered to be two sides of the same coin. While the former is the sustainability part of the story, the latter becomes the capital formation part of the story. Both financial capital and non-financial capital formation are considered along with their relationship to each other. Non-financial capital is referred to as intellectual capital and encompasses our customers, human resources, business partners, institutional integrity, community and environment. Report Scope and Boundaries The information contained in this report, as in the past, is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Following convergence with the International Financial Reporting Standards, Dimo adopted the new Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (known as SLFRSs and LKASs) from 1st April 2012. Financial Statements up to 31st March 2012 were prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards which were in effect up to that date. Accordingly, the Financial Statements for the previous year has been restated as per the new SLASs. Further, we are in compliance with the laws and regulations of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 and subsequent amendments and the Listing Rules of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). We continue to follow requirements of the Code of Best Practice on Corporate Governance issued jointly by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC). The Detailed Annual Report in our website provides the extent and manner in which we have complied with the code. The Detailed Annual Report also contains a Communication on Progress (COP) for United Nations Global Compacts’ ten principles. As before, the various metrics regarding our performance on sustainability are aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.1 guidelines at an application level of ‘A+’. We have used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard to GRI Content Index measure and report on our carbon footprint. This Annual Report pertains to activities of Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the Dimo Group, spanning a 12-month period ended 31st March 2013. There have been no changes in reporting scope and/or boundaries from the previous year. Non-financial information in this report pertaining to the previous year has not been restated, unless otherwise stated. Dimo is one of the 85 organisations participating in a Pilot Programme of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) that seeks to develop an international integrated reporting framework. The Independent Auditors’ opinion on the Financial Statements is available on page 80. 7 Context DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 A 360-Degree View of Highlights of the Year Report Approach…Setting Tone and Tenor Chairman’s Letter Chief Executive Officer’s Review Report Approach…Setting Tone and Tenor Stakeholder Identification and Engagement We begin our mapping process in the context of our eight strategic imperatives.

Chairman’s Letter Whilst all the signs are Dear Friends, that we are poised for The great thing about entrepreneurship is that you get to embrace challenge and opportunity with equal relish. I often feel that opportunity is also a challenge challenging one to make the best use of it. But perhaps I digress. sustained growth, it will pay us well to remain The degree of relish with which one meets challenge and opportunity is in direct proportion to how switched on one is. a fully switched on Over 74 years of enterprise, Dimo has striven to build a business ethos which embodies every aspect of a switched enterprise. on company and people. How successful we’ve been is to be seen in our performance as chronicled in the many publications of the Company. Over the years’ efforts of the past generations of the Dimo family, our own Dimo Tribe, have built a business edifice that we are proud of. A key attribute of switched on entities is that they learn to ride the rollercoaster-like vagaries of business, consistently staying on track, identifying the negatives, whilst prudently leveraging the positives. They accomplish this while always safeguarding the interests of the customer and progress of the employee alike. Without condescension, I have to say that this is what the year in review has been about, for Dimo. In fact, this is what it’s been about, throughout the history of Dimo. As I predicted in my letter to you last year, 2012 truly tested our mettle. Our business emphasis remaining predominantly vested in the automobile industry presented us with many challenges. Key among them was the reversal to a high import duty regime on new vehicles beginning April 2012. This challenge was exacerbated by our inability to offer a luxury vehicle within the prescribed CIF limit of the permit regime. As a result, we did not benefit from the large number of luxury vehicles that were imported under this scheme. All in all, the climate that prevailed in the year under review for our vehicles business was in sharp contrast to that of the preceding two years. The Government’s decision to rationalise tariffs on imports, particularly those of passenger cars, at the time, saw a dramatic bounce back of new motor vehicle registrations. This together with the low interest rate regime that prevailed made motor vehicles affordable like never seen in recent times before. Scan to view the Chairman’s Letter With this climate reversal, Dimo’s Group revenue contracted by 30% to Rs. 27.7 bn from Rs. 39.9 bn in 2011/12 whilst Group Profit After Tax too reduced by 83% to Rs. 462 mn. If there’s a silver lining, it is that we have done better than the 10 year compound annual growth rates (CAGR) recorded prior to 2010/11. However, from the national perspective, development and growth is indicated in many areas amongst them the infrastructure development, construction & technology and health & medical services sectors. The Group has significant interests in these areas and is geared to seize the opportunities that present themselves. Hence, Dimo remains highly optimistic of the future. Succinctly put, the country is poised to grow and Dimo has an important role to play in this growth. Among our core strategies, Dimo espouses the ‘Employee First’ approach. In an era which has enshrined a customerfirst approach, this may seem a radical departure from the norm. Not so. Our premise is that a contented, motivated, empowered and rightly skilled workforce WILL place the customer first, ensuring that they deliver exemplary service and do justice to the premium products of our Principals. In so doing, Dimo will also serve its Principals well. 13 Context DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 A 360-Degree View of Highlights of the Year Report Approach…Setting Tone and Tenor Chairman’s Letter Chief Executive Officer’s Review Chairman’s Letter The growth of our customer and employee capital, together with other parameters of performance described throughout this report, serve as proof that this approach delivers the desired outcome. In this regard, a fact of which we are particularly proud is that Dimo has been ranked among the top 15 ‘Great Places to Work’ in Sri Lanka, in a recent survey conducted. Looking ahead, whilst our portfolio lies predominantly in the automobile sector, our non-auto sectors are developing apace which will see the growth of the Group for all the right reasons. As always, Dimo grows a triple bottom line which is to say that sustainability is integrated into our business strategy and effort. We account and will always account for value generation and addition across economic, social and environmental parameters. Dimo is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and continues to be guided by its precepts. A word now about the fundaments that govern Dimo. Stewardship, trusteeship and accountability form the nucleus of the governance philosophy of Dimo and are embedded in our eight Strategic Imperatives. The Strategic Imperatives in turn provide the path to enterprise governance. In following this ethos, we deliver and derive stakeholder value with equal enthusiasm as detailed throughout this report. I am happy to report that the Board has recommended that we reward our shareholders with a final dividend of Rs 10/per share. I am always grateful for the enduring loyalty and trust our customers place in us. Dimo greatly values these relationships and is committed to nurturing and developing them further for many years to come. I thank every member of the Dimo Tribe whose unreserved effort and commitment lies at the heart of our enterprise and achievements. Dimo honours for yet another year, our Principals whose faith and confidence in us we treasure. I am grateful for the significant guidance and counsel extended by my colleagues on the Board of Directors. Together, I believe we have charted a course of optimal success for the Group. My colleague, Mr. Gladwin Peiris retires from the Board at the forthcoming AGM, after a very long association with the Company. I thank him on behalf of you all, for his yeomen service and valued contribution to the affairs of Dimo. I am looking forward to the year ahead. Whilst all the signs are that we are poised for sustained growth, it will pay us well to remain a fully switched on enterprise. A.R. Pandithage Chairman/Managing Director Colombo 21st May 2013 14 Context Chief Executive Officer’s Review Dimo kept to strategy we could look back on 2012/13 as a year of consolidation, during which we continued to invest in capacity development and property, plant and equipment. My first full year as CEO was a challenging one. Yet it also vividly demonstrated the strength of the Dimo Group. The economic climate in Sri Lanka over the year in review proved unfavourable for our vehicles segment, as fiscal and tariff policies in force led to a decrease in vehicle imports and reducing market size. There was a decline in demand for construction machinery too. Our other business segments performed well. Nevertheless, as our portfolio is heavily weighted towards the automobile industry, downturn in the fortunes of the vehicles segment proved to be the single greatest contributor to a corresponding downturn in turnover and profit. Group turnover for the year in review was Rs. 27.7 bn, down 30% when compared to Rs. 39.9 bn achieved the previous year. However, turnover in the after sales area of the vehicles segment and the electro mechanical, biomedical engineering and marine solutions segment grew by 31.6% and 34.2% respectively. The Group’s gross profit margin reduced from 18.2% to 15.2% for the year in review. Overall though, Dimo kept to strategy we could look back on 2012/13 as a year of consolidation, during which we continued to invest in capacity development and property, plant and equipment. We focussed much attention on enhancing capabilities and capacities of our staff particularly the management team, to help drive business plans and objectives more aggressively. In terms of infrastructure, work was completed on our auto workshop in Trincomalee, whilst work is ongoing on our proposed workshop in Jaffna and the new Mercedes Benz Centre. The latter is going to be a state of the art service centre for Mercedes Benz vehicles and has been designed with technical assistance from our principal Daimler AG. It will be one of the most modern and well-appointed facilities to be found anywhere in the world and certainly a trendsetter here in Sri Lanka. It is due to commence operations later in 2013. 15 Context DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 A 360-Degree View of Highlights of the Year Report Approach…Setting Tone and Tenor Chairman’s Letter Chief Executive Officer’s Review Chief Executive Officer’s Review We have plans to also increase the capacity of our workshop in Matara. Looking to the future, we will continue to widen our footprint and service to customers, by increasing our network of customer contact points and increasing the after sales facilities we offer. We see substantial potential, both in the short and long term, for our Agri equipment business, which will remain an area of special focus. Whilst Dimo’s pre-eminent focus remains firmly in the auto industry, the consistent growth witnessed in our electro mechanical, biomedical engineering and marine solutions business segment will figure largely in the continuing refinement of our portfolio mix. It is good to note that our constant efforts to refine processes and nurture and enhance our intellectual capital are paying dividends. Dimo is a regular recipient of awards and accolades among many received during the year in review were The Best Sustainability Report (awards from both The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and Association of Chartered Certified Accountants), one of the Top Ten Best Corporate Citizens awarded by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and one of the Top Ten companies for Best Practices in HR Awarded by the HR Professional’s Association Complete list of awards I am confident that Dimo has the correct strategies in place for the coming years. The capacity building and received during the year investment that have distinguished our enterprise this year will hold us in good stead for the opportunities to come in the future. A.G. Pandithage Director/Chief Executive Officer Colombo 21st May 2013 16 We have made it an art to grow our reach…build our own service competencies…offer responsible care and manage relationships optimally…we continue to exist. 17 Management Report DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 The Operating Environment...and Trends Refining our Portfolio…and Reinventing our Future Financial Value Creation Delivering Value to Customers...and their Value to Us Working at Dimo…Enjoyable and Rewarding Our Business Partners…A Symbiotic Relationship Regulatory Authorities…Playing by the Rules Our Community…Live and Let Live The Environment…Now and for Generations Yet Unborn Sustainability Performance Objectives in 2012-2013 The Operating Environment...and Trends In formulating this commentary we drew on material from several external sources. The Global Economy...a Tough Haul Ahead This has to be one of the most written about subjects in the world today but it needs repeating, if we are to set the tone for the rest of this report. A noticeable slowdown in the emerging markets and developing economies characterised 2012. GDP growth in these economies which stood at 4% in 2011 slowed to 3.2% in 2012. Key influential factors were a sharp deceleration in demand from several advanced economies as well as tightening of domestic policy and the end of investment booms in some of the major emerging market economies. Global prospects have improved again but the road to recovery in the advanced economies will remain bumpy. World output growth is forecast to reach 3.25% in 2013 and 4% in 2014. The World’s Auto Industry...Still a Growth Sector Auto sales growth in China, the world’s largest car market, fell short of expectations last year, as the economy slowed. Sales grew by 4.3% YoY in 2012, well below the forecast of 8%. In the USA, the year 2012 signalled a welcome recovery for the auto industry. Sales increased by 13% over 2011. Japanese manufacturers too had a good year with sales up by 20% over the previous year and in the process, shaking off the doldrums of post tsunami inventory shortages that prevailed last year. Despite a revival in the US and strong sales in Japan, the global automobile industry is not expected to repeat its success. According to various estimates, the global auto industry is likely to record a growth of just over 2% in 2013, compared to the growth of 5% achieved in 2012. This is attributable to the sluggish progress of the economies of Ranjith Pandithage countries in Europe and Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). Chairman/Managing Director In summary, the auto industry is expected to remain a growth sector, though not at the same high level as in past years. Sri Lanka’s Economy records Modest Growth The economy grew by a modest 6.4% in 2012. Inflation was maintained in ‘single digit territory’, at 9.2% for the fourth consecutive year despite several global and domestic areas of challenge. Country Report The relative ‘boom’ we saw in 2010 and 2011, with GDP growth reaching and exceeding 8%, largely evaporated in the year under review. High credit, monetary expansion and a widening trade deficit fuelled by high import demand led the Central Bank to adopt a comprehensive policy package in early 2012, involving monetary, exchange rate and fiscal elements as well as adjustments to administratively determined prices. This ushered in a regime of raised policy interest rates and a ceiling being imposed on rupee lending by licensed banks to moderate credit growth, although the latter was relaxed from the beginning of 2013. 18 Management Report The Operating Environment...and Trends Interest rates which followed an upward trend during the first three quarters, slightly eased in the fourth quarter, coinciding with the removal of the ceiling placed on credit growth of banks in 2012. The AWPLR, to which most of the Company’s borrowings are linked, increased from 12.65% as at 01st April 2012 to 13.77% as at 31st March 2013. The Sri Lankan Rupee appreciated by 2.41% against the US Dollar during the year and stood at Rs. 126.89 at the year end, compared to Rs. 129.95 at the beginning of the year. Let us now look at individual economic sector performances. These are pertinent, as Dimo has substantial interests in these areas through its diversified portfolio. In the Transportation sub-sector, the Government’s Tariff/Fiscal policies led to a sharp fall in sale and registration of motor vehicles. The number of new vehicles registered during 2012 decreased by 24% to 397,295 compared to an increase of 46% in the previous year. As over 75% of the Group’s business revolves around the vehicle segment, this information needs to be ‘digested’ and addressed.

The performance of the Industry Sector was driven by substantial forward momentum in the Construction sub-sector, which recorded an impressive growth of 21.6% compared to 14.2% in 2011. This is the highest growth registered by the sub sector in the past ten years. Overall, the Industry sector, which accounts for approximately 30.4% of GDP, grew by 10.3% in 2012, contributing substantially to the expansion of the economy. Growth in the Services Sector, which is the largest sector of the economy, accounting for 58.5% of GDP moderated to 4.6% in 2012 from 8.6% in 2011. Pertinent Aspects of Sri Lanka’s Economic and Social Infrastructure Power Electricity generation in 2012 increased moderately by 2.4% to 11,800 GWh compared to 11,528 GWh in 2011. The share of power generated by Ceylon Electricity Board, in relation to total power generation decreased to 52% in 2012 from 57% in 2011, reflecting the increase in the share of power produced by the private sector from 43% to 48%.

The National Water Supply & Drainage Board provided 137,874 new water connections in 2012. Thereby the total number of connections managed by them reached 1.6 mn, reflecting a 9.5% increase. Water supply and irrigation is a key target segment for the Fluid Management Business of the Group. Health In recent times, there has been a surge in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD), such as heart diseases, diabetes and cancer. While NCDs have beaten communicable diseases as the leading cause of death in the country, the trend is expected to continue in the context of an increasingly aging population. It is expected that the growing per capita income will entail significant changes to lifestyles, adding major risk factors for developing chronic NCDs. The target sector of the Bio Medical Engineering Business is the health sector. What the Local Economy holds in Store... This is about ambition, alignment and attainment the alliterative 3 ‘a’s! Sri Lanka has set its sights on developing into a USD 100 bn economy by 2016 Ambition. The achievement of this goal would demand significant improvement of all public utilities from their current levels. Alignment. Gahanath Pandithage Director/Chief Executive Officer Sri Lanka’s labour market needs to be re-oriented to face the challenges of achieving sustainable high economic growth. The unemployment rate, which has remained below 5% since 2010, reached a historic low of 4% in 2012. Although such low rates of unemployment could give rise to wage pressures, low labour force participation rates and possible underemployment in some sectors, indications are that there is still room for the supply of labour to improve. The challenge of an ageing population caused by the slow population growth needs to be addressed with a long-term focus through strengthening retirement benefit schemes and reforming the health sector. Sri Lanka’s achievements in reducing absolute poverty, even while facing an internal conflict, are well documented, but focused policies to eradicate poverty and reduce income inequality need to continue. It is essential to strengthen the framework for sustained economic growth based on the strategy of 5 hubs (aviation, maritime, energy, commercial and knowledge) plus tourism to diversify the economy and improve the resilience of the economy to external and internal shocks. The implementation of required structural adjustments including tax reforms and exchange control liberalisation, strengthening of institutions, and the continuation of the fiscal consolidation process are desirable for Sri Lanka to sustain this high growth momentum. Attainment is an ongoing journey...read us next year; there’s bound to be progress...a great deal of it! In this environment, our next step was to look closely at key elements of our business. 20 Management Report Refining our Portfolio…and Reinventing our Future A Forward Looking Note Guiding Philosophy Continuous refinement of the portfolio Managing an investment portfolio is essentially about diversification, with the strategic objective of selecting a mix and the resulting improvement in of investment assets that collectively has a lower risk than any individual asset.

The Dimo portfolio is skewed towards the vehicles segment, which contributed to more than half of Group gross profit, followed by vehicle parts & service, machinery for construction, agriculture and materials handling, lighting & power tools and electro-mechanical & biomedical engineering. The concentration on vehicles reflects our origins, as well as our core competencies. We have stuck to our knitting in this important sector of the economy, but have greatly grown our product and service offerings within the sector, in terms of breadth and depth. One may call it an intra-sectoral diversification that further strengthens our position in the sector. The diversity of our portfolio is an undeniable strength. We strive each day to optimally manage our portfolio with some obvious benefits to Company and stakeholder alike. In fine tuning and refining the portfolio, Dimo seeks continuous improvement in its financial positioning; in our book, value derived must be accompanied by value delivered. This is how we seek to maximise shareholder value. Managing the portfolio mix to derive optimal results and returns is a continuous process. Dimo constantly revisits its portfolio and pursues a pro-active path of differentiation; we look at upgrades to plant and equipment, new product models and constantly developing our service regimes. We’re also exploring more diversification in areas such as building and construction technologies, power solutions, medical equipment, consultancy and advisory services, training academies and marine repairs among others. 21 Management Report DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 The Operating Environment...and Trends Refining our Portfolio…and Reinventing our Future Financial Value Creation Delivering Value to Customers...and their Value to Us Working at Dimo…Enjoyable and Rewarding Our Business Partners…A Symbiotic Relationship Regulatory Authorities…Playing by the Rules Our Community…Live and Let Live The Environment…Now and for Generations Yet Unborn Sustainability Performance Objectives in 2012-2013 Financial Value Creation Key Performance Area Metric 2012/13 2011/12 2010/11 2009/10 Profitability Sales (Rs. mn) 27,711 39,863 29,357 10,530 Gross profit ratio (%) 15.21 18.23 20.30 22.70 Net profit ratio (%) 1.70 6.81 7.20 2.40 Working capital management Current ratio (times)-at the year end 1.71 1.60 1.27 1.28 Quick Assets Ratio (times)-at the year end 0.72 0.36 0.84 0.78 Fixed Assets Turnover (times) 4.98 8.55 9.59 4.92 Asset Utilization Capital expenditure as percentage of total assets (%) 8.50 6.20 9.90 7.00 Capital structure Debt/Equity (%) at year end 10.10 13.40 9.80 30.20 Interest cover (times) 2.24 15.67 17.35 2.12 A Forward Looking Note Guiding Philosophy We are focused on improving Dimo perceives that financial value creation is the mechanism that converts financial and non-financial inputs profitability through gross profit margin, to certain outputs that are measured as financial performance.

Interest rates on overdrafts are reviewed periodically while rates charged on short term/import loans are determined based on market rates. Treasury Management The Group operates a central treasury function. It controls decisions in respect of cash management, utilisation of borrowing facilities, banking relationships, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure management. Further, it facilitates effective cross utilisation of funds between business units. Cash Flow Funds generated from operating activities increased to Rs. 4,111.3 mn (Cash out flow of Rs. 55.6 mn 2011/12) despite a significantly lower operating profit. This was possible due to the reduction in working capital requirements consequent to a reduction in inventory. This helped the Company to generate a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of Rs. 1,763.1 mn (a net decrease of Rs. 2,941 mn 2011/12) after cash outflows on investing and 23 Management Report DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 The Operating Environment...and Trends Refining our Portfolio…and Reinventing our Future Financial Value Creation Delivering Value to Customers...and their Value to Us Working at Dimo…Enjoyable and Rewarding Our Business Partners…A Symbiotic Relationship Regulatory Authorities…Playing by the Rules Our Community…Live and Let Live The Environment…Now and for Generations Yet Unborn Sustainability Performance Objectives in 2012-2013 Financial Value Creation Composition of Gross financing activities.

Marketing & Distribution Construction & Material Handling Equipment & After Services Financial Performance Electro Mechanical & Bio Medical Engineering & Marine Solutions Overview * Comparative figures are in brackets The overall performance during the year was below expectations. The profit before tax reduced by 87 % to Rs. 490 mn from Rs. 3,724.5 mn in 2011/12. Lower turnover and gross profit margins were two key factors that affected the profit before tax. Increase in administrative expenses and net finance cost too created an adverse impact on profits. Cost and Expenses 2012/13 As a result of the turnover of the vehicles, construction & material handling equipment, commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles segments dropping, Group turnover reduced by 30% to Rs. 27.7 bn from Rs. 39.9 bn the 1% [1%]* 11% [7%]* previous year. The reduction in vehicles segment turnover is mainly attributed to the reduction in the market size or 2% [2%]* the number of vehicles imported into the country. The statistics pertaining to vehicle imports are given on page 19. The demand for the construction machinery did not correspond to the growth in the construction sector. On the other hand, turnover of vehicles after-sales segment & electro-mechanical, biomedical engineering and marine solutions segment increased by 31.6% and 34.2% respectively. Profitability The gross profit margin reduced from 18.2% to 15.2%. This is primarily attributed to the lower margins in the vehicle related businesses. The vehicle permit regime under which a large number of passenger vehicles were imported on 86% [90%]* concessionary tariff and the lower demand for vehicles created pressure on gross profit margins. Cost of Sales Distribution On the other hand, administration expenses and distribution expenses taken together increased by 4%. Administrative Financing Cost The reduction in the distribution expenses is due to the decrease in the provision for impairment of receivables * Comparative figures are in brackets as a result of the change in the provisioning policy in order to be in line with adoption of LKAS 39. The impact due to the change in policy is given in Note 38 to the Financial Statements. In the backdrop of increased borrowing rates, a higher level of borrowings during the first half of the year, the net finance cost increased to Rs. 395.5 mn from Rs. 253.9 mn in the previous year. 24 Management Report Financial Value Creation Earnings Taxation Rs. mn The rate of income tax applicable to the Company and subsidiaries was 28%, whilst the rate of income tax 5,000 applicable for exports was a concessionary rate of 12%.

The CRM Division currently provides a monthly data analysis service to the vehicle segment, which is subsequently circulated to all business segments. All other business segments analyse their data on a quarterly basis in consultation with senior management. This data is invaluable to the Company as it seeks constantly to enhance problem solving and product and process refinement. The role of CRM can be displayed in three main aspects as in Profiling the Customer, Engaging the Customer and Nurturing Customer Relationships. Our Customers’ Features To us Dimo customers are not of mere names...never lines on a graph. They’re very real...and we know them well! Currently, Dimo enjoys the patronage of 42,000 direct customers individuals, businesses and Government as well as a large differentiated dealer network. Our dealers in turn serve several hundreds of thousands of consumers of our products. During the year under review, many customer campaigns and customer profiling surveys were conducted within the Vehicle Sales and After Sales Division. Approximately 24,000 customers were reached through these surveys. A key objective of these surveys, among others, was to identify prospective customer segments with potential to generate further business opportunities for the Company. It is an interesting and important feature of our business that many of our customers are exposed to and served by more than one of our business segments. This indicates the efficacy of the ‘One Dimo’ concept at work, as customers are introduced to the total Dimo product and service offering. Engagement We engage with our customers on a variety of issues in order to understand them well. During the year under review, we conducted several one to one surveys to identify customer concerns. These concerns were then addressed in accordance with their materiality and importance. The most material concerns identified during the survey this year was the issue of product information not being shared adequately with the customers. This was addressed by conducting training sessions on product knowledge to ensure sales staff have adequate knowledge of the products we offer.

Employee training and development needs are mapped according to job and career advancement potential in relation to the Company’s own development and progress. This is an inclusive process that makes full use of the performance evaluation system. A training calendar is formulated and all training imparted is assessed for effectiveness through participants’ feedback as well as the Company’s own evaluation process. Training opportunities are provided both locally (from internal and external sources) and overseas. Dimo fosters the learning habit. Job-related educational expenses and subscriptions for membership in professional bodies are reimbursed by the Company in a bid to promote knowledge acquisition and personal development.

There’s a lot of listening, meeting, discussing, analysing and more that goes on across the many channels of communication that Dimo has in place across the Group. Several channels of communication are open, two ways, to facilitate and nurture great employee relationships. Once a month, the Employees’ Council meets this is an open forum where employees discuss their concerns with top management including the Chairman/MD, CEO of the Company. All Executive Directors, General Managers, Business Unit Managers and a representative from each business unit participate at these meetings. Minutes of the meetings are posted on the Company’s intranet and can be viewed by any employee. A unique programme, Working @ Dimo, provides an opportunity for employees to express their views, experiences and feelings for/of the Company. Each week an employee is given the opportunity to publish his/her work-related experience on the intranet. 36 Management Report Working at Dimo…Enjoyable and Rewarding HR Clinics is a scheme where HR personnel visit staff at their location of work to initiate dialogue on any issue/ concern that needs speedy resolution.

Similar attention and investments were made in training and development of our employees, to bring them on par with international standards. We ensured also, that our technical and support staff were constantly updated on technological developments. Knowing whether you are where you want to be is a key factor in benchmarking ourselves. To this end we conduct research, surveys and face to face interviews with stakeholders from time to time. We have entrusted this activity to specialist third party organisations.

As depicted in our diagram appearing above, Dimo has identified six strategic areas in respect of the management of environmental issues. On the subject of atmospheric emissions, the correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change is irrefutable today. Steeped as our business is in the automobile trade, we constantly strive to manage such harmful Dilrukshi Kurukulasuriya emissions and by implication, our carbon footprint. General Manager This is the fifth consecutive year in which we have calculated and reported on our carbon footprint. Human Resources Direct GHG emissions from diesel for vehicles, vehicle delivery and service processes amounted to 2,914 tCO2e Member Group Management Committee (3,972 tCO2e in 2011/12), which comprised 47% (59% last year) of our total carbon footprint. Due mainly to the reductions we have been able to effect in diesel fuel consumption for vehicle delivery and service processes, our overall carbon footprint reduced by 5%. Dimo employs a number of measures to control and manage the emission factor. Environmental initiatives 48 Management Report The Environment…Now and for Generations Yet Unborn Some of these include compliance with strict emission controls for all vehicles, whether Company owned or hired; the operation of exhaust gas and dust extractors in vulnerable areas; installation of filtration systems in paint booths; operation of fresh air validation systems in Engine Repair facility; use of CFC free gases and the increasing usage of teleand video-conferencing as a means to curtail air travel. Dimo meticulously manages its fuel and energy consumption. For the year under review, The Group has been able to reduce its overall energy consumption by 33%. Some measures we adopted in the cause of energy efficiency and conservation were the constant conduct of energy audits which led to the use of capacitor banks for power factor correction, replacement of incandescent lighting with CFL and LED technology (almost all areas of the Group have been converted), programming all computers to revert to standby mode within a 5 minute idling period, setting air conditioning units at a constant minimum of 24oC or over and inculcating a culture amongst the staff of ‘switching it off’ turning off lights and computers when not in use. Our energy saving solutions bought many savings to our customers. During the year under review, energy audits were conducted and upon implementing its findings, an annual saving of 52,032 kWh was realised. Through sales of Electronic Control equipment, a total annual energy saving of 314,475 kWh was achieved during the period in review. As a substantial consumer, water management is a prime area of focus. Dimo’s requirements of water are sourced mainly from the national supply. Ground water sources have also been tapped in certain locations at Siyambalape and Anuradhapura Workshop, Weliweriya Logistics Centre and Colombo. Ananda Mapalagama The Group uses water mainly for vehicle repairs and servicing and for domestic purposes as well. General Manager The Group’s total water usage from all sources was 101,984 M3 of which 10% or 10,069 M3 was recycled and Infrastructure Development re-used. Total water usage has risen this year due to increase in the workshop throughput. Member Group Management Committee Reuse and recycle are the watchwords in our waste management regime. Waste water from all our workshops pass through oil separators and are monitored to ascertain their pH levels, to ensure compliance with legal limits. The Company operates biological water treatment and recycling plants at TATA Commercial workshop/Construction machinery workshop at Siyambalape and Dimo Logistic centre Weliveriya. Water treatment plants are also available at the Mercedes Benz passenger car workshop and TATA passenger car workshops at Colombo, Branches of TATA commercial workshop at Ratnapura, Anuradhapura, Matara, Kurunegala, Kandy and Trincomalee. Water recycled is used for industrial purposes and not for domestic purposes.

The presence of the SID provides a workable mechanism to review the role played by the Chairman. Whilst the role of the Chairman entails providing leadership in observing best practices of corporate governance, my role as the SID calls for a review of the Board’s effectiveness. The presence of the SID also provides emphasis to transparency in matters relating to governance. Dimo is committed to principles of good governance and always strives to live by the Code of Best Practices on Corporate Governance. The governance culture of the Company is strongly embraced by the Board of Directors. The Company follows a policy of strict compliance with laws, regulatory requirements and the Code of Ethics. A Director is permitted to obtain independent professional advice that may be required in discharging his responsibilities, at the Company’s expense. As the SID, which role I have played since May 2009, I am consulted by Chairman on major strategic and governance issues. As the SID, I make myself available to any Director to have any confidential discussions on the affairs of the Company, should the need arise. By virtue of being the Chairman of the Audit Committee, I also meet Independent Auditors and Internal Auditors and obtain their views on any matters of concern. R. Seevaratnam Senior Independent Director Colombo 21st May 2013 52 Stewardship Enterprise Governance Philosophy Enterprise governance is in the core of the corporate philosophy of Dimo. It perceives good governance as an uncompromising pursuit that provides the platform for growth in a sustainable manner; not as a set of controls that stifles growth. Governance Policy Dimo is committed to a policy of transparent, accountable and responsible governance. In doing so, the Board accepts the position of trusteeship, stewardship and accountability that is placed upon it. The Board’s objective is to deliver superior returns to all stakeholders and it is done in conformity with the eight strategic imperatives. Governance Model The Board identifies the scope of enterprise governance through its eight strategic imperatives. This signifies that the conformance and performance aspects of governance should be identified through the strategic imperatives. Duties of responsible trusteeship, faithful stewardship and uncompromising accountability underpin the manner in which Dimo is committed to good governance through its eight strategic imperatives, in its pursuit of creating value and accumulating financial and non-financial wealth for its stakeholders. Conformance and performance requirements demand a robust enterprise governance framework. Nishantha Mudannayake Governance Framework Group IT Manager The ultimate responsibility for good governance rests with the Board of Directors. In order to effectively fulfil this responsibility, the Board has in place a governance structure and a process to monitor its effectiveness. Member Group Management The Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee together with the Group Committee Management Committee play a leading role in ensuring effective enterprise governance. The governance framework is designed taking into consideration the demands placed by the aspects of conformance and performance along with legislative and regulatory requirements and best practices of enterprise governance. It consists of a governance structure, regulation framework and assurance and certification sources. 53 Stewardship DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 Enterprise Governance Risk Management Report of the Audit Committee Remuneration Committee Report Nomination Committee Report Responsibility Statement of Chairman/Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Enterprise Governance Governance Framework REGULATION FRAMEWORK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ASSURANCE & CERTIFICATION External Regulation Assurance of Financial Information Code of Best Practice Independent on Corporate Audit Governance issued Board of Directors jointly by SEC and ICASL Corporate Governance Board Committees Rules published by the CSE Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 Remuneration Nomination Audit GRI Guidelines on Independent Review Committee Committee Committee Sustainability Internal Audit Management Committees Internal Regulation Independent Certification Articles of Association QMS Audit & Quality Management Certification System (QMS) Sustainability Group Management Committee Committee EMS Audit & Environment Certification Management System (EMS) Assurance of Non-Financial Code of Business Information Ethics Employees’ Head of Business Councils Units Internal Control System Risk Management Conformance and Performance The driving force of conformance and performance is the onus that is placed upon the Board by the expectations of trusteeship, stewardship and accountability although there are many laws, regulations, best practices and expectations that shape these two dimensions of governance.

Whilst, being fully compliant with demands of the laws and regulations relating to corporate governance, the Company recognises that best practices provide a robust framework for sustainable growth and meeting stakeholder expectations. Enterprise governance requires high levels of commitment across the organisation and it is essential that an enabling governance culture is created. This envisages creation of awareness at all levels. All employees are expected to respect the strategic imperatives in achieving their own objectives set by the management and in achieving the objectives of the Company. Financial value creation is not encouraged at the cost of other strategic imperatives. The sustenance of enterprise governance principles is facilitated by aligning the strategic imperatives into its value adding process, and making a conscious effort to continually improve the governance framework and processes. Compliance Compliance is monitored through the monitoring of the point of reference/s. In the event of the point of reference being a code of best practice, guideline, legislation or a rule, the compliance is monitored through ascertainment of compliance with the point of reference. On the other hand where the point of reference is a body of persons such as a Management Committee, the compliance is monitored by comparing the stated expectations or goals with the actual status. Assurance and Comfort Independent assurance, independent review, oversight and independent certification are key sources of assurance and comfort with regard to integrity and due functioning of the enterprise governance framework. This is depicted in the governance framework appearing on page 54. The Three Lines of Defence approach, which is described later, provides comfort on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management. 58 Stewardship Enterprise Governance Lines of Defence The comfort level derived from assurance is reliant upon on the internal controls that are in place. Whilst the internal controls focus on the current operations and decisions, the risk and management focuses on the uncertainties that the Group is exposed to. The ‘Three Lines of Defence’ model given below depicts the approach followed in ensuring effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management: O w n er e of Defe nc e L in Three Lines of Defence Heads of Internal First Line of Defence Business Units Controls Group Management Committee Oversight Second Line of Defence of Internal Controls & Risk Management Audit Committee Independent Third Line of Defence Assurance Independent Auditor Internal Controls The Board has delegated the oversight function of the internal controls to the Audit Committee.

In addition, the Group has to manage risks that arise from its operations. Thus, a need arises to identify and manage risks. The systematic approach required for risk management calls for measures that ensure that risks are identified on time, evaluated in terms of risk appetite of the Group and effective management and monitoring mechanisms are installed. Risk Management Structure The Board is primarily responsible for ensuring that the risks are identified and appropriately managed across the Group. The Audit Committee has been delegated the responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s Risk Management process, including the systems established to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks. The Internal Audit function also plays a key role in risk identification. The Group Management Committee (GMC) takes the lead at the implementation level in identifying risks. The GMC examines processes and events that expose the Company into situations that could seriously reduce earnings, impair its liquidity position or create legal, regulatory or reputation risks. The GMC also evaluates options available to mitigate risks and to identify risks that do not match the risk appetite of the Group. Monitoring of risk management measures is a responsibility that rests with the GMC. Wijith Pushpawela General Manager Power & Heads of Business Units provide useful information and feed back to the GMC for risk management with the Medical Engineering assistance of the employees of the Group Member Group Management Committee Board of Risk Appetite Risk Management Structure Directors Audit Oversight Committee Review Group Identify Management Implement Committee Monitor Heads of Measurement Business Feedback Units Feedback Employees 64 Stewardship Risk Management Risk Evaluation Where a risk is evaluated it takes into account the likelihood of an event and its potential impact on the business. Impacts are quantified or assessed in terms of potential loss or damage. Risks are assessed both as gross risk and net risk. The assessment of gross risk involves the potential harm it can cause without mitigating actions, whereas net risk assessment considers potential harm or loss when mitigating action is taken. Risks and their corresponding mitigating action plans are reviewed by the GMC. Risk Mapping Risk mapping is carried out in order to assess the likelihood of occurrence and consequences of an event/set of events: • Likelihood of occurrence is assessed on the basis of past experience and the preventive measures in place. A ranking of high, medium and low in terms of the probability of occurrence is assigned for each risk. • The impact of the event is assessed by determining the loss it would cause and the extent of the impact. By considering these two factors, the impact is then categorised as low, moderate and significant. Upon assessment of the likelihood of occurrence and the extent of the impact of each risk, it is subjected to the following matrix in order to derive the nature and intensity of action required. Risk Management Actions Impact Considerable Monitoring Must Manage & Extensive Management Significant Required Monitor Risk Essential Moderate Accept Risk with Monitoring & Management Considerable Management Monitoring Effort Worthwhile Effort Required Low Accept Risk Accept, but Monitor Risk Manage & Monitor Risk Low Medium High Likelihood 65 Stewardship DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 Enterprise Governance Risk Management Report of the Audit Committee Remuneration Committee Report Nomination Committee Report Responsibility Statement of Chairman/Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Risk Management Risk Management Actions The table given below sets out an assessment of risks that the strategic imperatives were subject to towards the year-end and risk mitigating actions that were/ are in place: Strategic Imperatives and Associated Risks Strategic Imperative 1 Refine the Portfolio Mix of Our Business Continuously Risk factor/implications Composition of product portfolio: The vehicles and vehicle parts/services segment accounts for a significant share of Group’s revenues and negative changes to the fiscal policies would adversely impact on Group’s performance.

The Art of our Science Putting this report together required a marriage of art and science. We want to tell you a bit about the art. Our artistic medium was inspired by traditional Sri Lankan decorative art dating back over 2,000 years and visible in a variety of artistic expression across the country from wall paintings to rock sculptures, carvings and more. Working in acrylics, we chose the diversity of Dimo’s business as our unique canvas. The examples you see rendered in this report will be permanently on display at our new Mercedes Benz Centre in Colombo...a celebration of the art of science. 127 DIESEL & MOTOR ENGINEERING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 Appendices Notice of Meeting NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the Sixty-Eighth Annual General Meeting of Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC will be held at the Registered Office of the Company, No. 65, Jetawana Road, Colombo 14, on Friday, 28th June 2013 at 10.00 a.m. and the business to be brought before the meeting will be: Agenda 1.
