Person responsible for the Reference Document Mr. Luc Oursel, Chief Executive Oﬃcer of AREVA D 1.2. Attestation by the person responsible for the Reference Document “I hereby attest, having taken every reasonable measure to this eﬀect, and to the best of my knowledge, that the information contained in this Reference Document fairly reﬂects the current situation and that no material aspects of such information have been omitted. I attest that, to my knowledge, the ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and give a fair presentation of the assets, ﬁnancial position and operating results of the company and of all consolidated companies, and that the management report of the Executive Board, whose structure is described in Appendix 7 of this Reference Document, presents a fair picture of the business, income and ﬁnancial position of the company and of all consolidated companies as well as a description of the main risks and uncertainties they confront. I have received an end-of-engagement letter from the Statutory Auditors indicating that they have veriﬁed information relating to the ﬁnancial position and the ﬁnancial statements provided in this reference document and have read the entire report. The end-of-engagement letter does not contain any observations. The historical ﬁnancial information presented in this Reference Document has been covered in reports by the Statutory Auditors, which contain observations. Without qualifying the Statutory Auditors’ ﬁndings on the ﬁnancial statements, their report on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 on page 188 of this Reference Document draws attention to: 1 Note 24 describes the diﬃculties in the performance of the contract for the study and building of components for an experimental reactor prototype, and the additional costs amounting to between 120 and 200 million euros resulting from the time lag in the project schedule not taken into account in the loss at completion of this contract. This note also describes the discussions in progress with the client in order to continue the project without having to bear these additional costs. The failure of these negotiations could lead to a signiﬁcant increase in the provisions recognized; 1 Note 24 describes the reasons that led Areva to apply paragraph 32 of IAS 11 as from the second half of 2013 and the methods of recognition applicable to the OL3 contract. In addition, this note speciﬁes the conditions of completion of this contract and the sensitivity of the income at completion to legal risks, as well as to the operational conditions for the end of construction and testing until the reactor is put into service; 8 2013 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT 1.2. PERSON RESPONSIBLE Attestation by the person responsible for the Reference Document 1 1 Notes 1.2.5 and 9 describe the treatment and impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the discontinued operations (wind power and solar energy activities, as well as a subsidiary specialized in IT services); 1 Notes 1.18 and 13 describe the procedures for measuring the provisions for end-of-lifecycle operations, and their sensitivity to the assumptions used in terms of technical processes, costs, disbursement schedules and inﬂation and discount rates. The reports on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 contain observations, are incorporated by reference and appear on page 201 of the 2011 Reference Document and on page 191 of the 2012 Reference Document.” Courbevoie, March 31, 2014 Luc Oursel Chief Executive Oﬃcer of AREVA 2013 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT 9 2 Statutory Auditors D 2.1.

Other international agreements adopted under the umbrella of the IAEA govern nuclear safety in the facilities, including the Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS) and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. With respect to the European Union, the provisions of the Euratom Treaty and of the environment, and the monitoring of radioactive and nonand its implementing provisions reinforced the aspects related to nuclear radioactive releases. The license decrees required for certain operations materials safeguards and established a common set of rules, in particular are granted following a public inquiry and an administrative process concerning public health protection, radiation protection of workers and requiring the opinion of several organizations.

A “nuclear steam supply system” Since the beginning of this century, energy has been a centerpiece is the combination of equipment used to produce steam from of many of our society’s challenges, which may be summed up ﬁssion energy. A “nuclear island” is the system encompassing as the need to continue to produce and consume energy without the nuclear steam supply system and the fuel-related facilities, threatening the climate. If the share of fossil fuels in the global as well as the equipment required for the system’s operation and energy mix is to be reduced from its current level of more than 80%, safety. A “conventional island” consists of the alternating current low-carbon energy sources that do not aﬀect the climate must be turbogenerator coupled to the nuclear island, along with the developed, including nuclear power, capable of producing massive equipment required for its operation. A nuclear power plant thus quantities of electricity on demand, and renewable energies. consists primarily of a nuclear island and a conventional island. The reactor is enclosed in a reinforced containment building meeting Using ﬁssion energy in nuclear power plants nuclear safety requirements. The three main components needed A nuclear power plant is an electric generating station with one or to sustain, control and cool the ﬁssion process in the reactor core more reactors. Like all conventional thermal power plants, it consists are fuel, a moderator and a coolant. The combination of these notably of a steam supply system that converts water into steam. The three components determines the reactor type or model. Several steam drives a turbine, which in turn drives a generator, producing combinations have been tested, but only a few of them have gone electricity. beyond the prototype stage to commercial operation. 42 2013 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT BUSINESS OVERVIEW 6 A heat source and a cooling source D PRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR Like all other thermal power plants, a nuclear power plant has a Primary cooling system heat source (the nuclear steam supply system with its fuel core Steam generator and heat exchangers) and a cooling source designed to condense Secondary cooling system steam after it has passed through the turbine. That is why power steam water Pressurizer plants are usually built near the sea or a river – the water is used to Control cool the steam. Some power plants are also equipped with cooling rod drive Reactor mechanisms Generator towers in which cooling water is dispersed like rain so that it will coolant pump evaporate, improving the eﬃciency of cooling and reducing the environmental impacts (reduced withdrawal of water, elimination of thermal releases to rivers). Reactor core Feedwater pump Reactor Condenser A moderator and a coolant vessel Reheater Cooling water During the ﬁssion process, neutrons are released at very high speed. As they strike light atoms (hydrogen contained in water) and slow down, they react much more with the uranium-235 atoms.

Renewable energies Renewable energies – hydropower, biomass, wind, solar, geothermal Diﬀerence between generation II and generation III and ocean energies – do not consume natural resources for their reactor systems operations.

They represent signiﬁcant advances in terms of competitiveness, nuclear safety and reduced environmental impacts. AREVA’s reactors capitalize on proven technologies while integrating innovative systems. These reactor models feature a very high level of nuclear safety due to strengthened incident and accident prevention measures (redundancies, diversity, combination of active and passive systems, geographic separation, bunkering, etc.) and environmental protection measures (containment, core catchment systems, hydrogen recombiners, etc.). They are also designed to withstand earthquakes and the crash of a wide-body commercial aircraft. The reactors are designed to be operated for at least 60 years, compared with the reactors currently in operation in France, which were initially designed to operate for 40 years, although their robustness makes their lifecycle extension foreseeable. Measures were taken from the beginning of the design phase to reduce environmental impacts by aiming for better fuel utilization and waste volume reduction, for example by optimizing fuel burnup or authorizing Source: AREVA. plutonium recycling in the form of mixed oxide fuel (MOX).

These consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been approved by the Executive Board. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. I. OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the ﬁnancial position of the Group as at 31 December 2013 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the following matters set out in the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements: 1 Note 24 describes the diﬃculties in the performance of the contract for the study and building of components for an experimental reactor prototype, and the additional costs amounting to between 120 and 200 million euros resulting from the time lag in the project schedule not taken into account in the loss at completion of this contract. This note also describes the discussions in progress with the client in order to continue the project without having to bear these additional costs. The failure of these negotiations could lead to a signiﬁcant increase in the provisions recognized; 1 Note 24 describes the reasons that led Areva to apply paragraph 32 of IAS 11 as from the second half of 2013 and the methods of recognition applicable to the OL3 contract. In addition, this note speciﬁes the conditions of completion of this contract and the sensitivity of the income at completion to legal risks, as well as to the operational conditions for the end of construction and testing until the reactor is put into service; 1 Notes 1.2.5 and 9 describe the treatment and impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the discontinued operations (wind power and solar energy activities, as well as a subsidiary specialized in IT services); 1 Notes 1.18 and 13 describe the procedures for measuring the provisions for end-of-lifecycle operations, and their sensitivity to the assumptions used in terms of technical processes, costs, disbursement schedules and inﬂation and discount rates. II. JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: 1 Areva recognizes the proﬁt or loss on long-term contracts according to the methods described in Notes 1.8 and 24 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We assessed the data and assumptions on which the estimated income at completion and changes therein are based. We examined the procedures for management’s approval of these estimates and reviewed the calculations made; 1 Provisions for end-of-lifecycle operations have been measured according to the methods described in Note 1.18 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We reviewed the implementation of these methods, the assumptions used and the cost estimates obtained. Oﬀsetting these provisions, Areva recognizes ﬁnancial assets to cover the end-of-lifecycle operations, which include a dedicated portfolio composed of directly held shares and units of equity and bond mutual funds. The portfolio management objectives and measurement principles are described in Notes 13, 1.13.1, 1.13.3 and 1.13.8 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We assessed the appropriateness of the methods used and the measurement of the provisions for impairment of the ﬁnancial assets. 188 2013 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 20.1.1 20.1. 2013 Consolidated ﬁnancial statements Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 20 1 Goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment have been tested for impairment according to the principles and assumptions described in Notes 1.10, 10, 11 and 12 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We examined the methods used to perform these tests, and assessed the consistency of the assumptions adopted with the forecast data from Areva’s strategic action plan, and the approach used to estimate the fair value of certain mining assets. We also veriﬁed that Notes 1.10, 10, 11 and 12 of the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements provide appropriate disclosures. 1 The principles for the recognition of deferred tax assets are described in Notes 1.23 and 8 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We examined the methods used to make these estimates, veriﬁed the consistency of the forecast taxable income with the strategic action plan and assessed the timeframes taken into consideration against the tax loss carryforward time limitations and the speciﬁc position of each tax consolidation group. 1 The accounting principles relating to employee beneﬁts are described in Notes 1, 1.1, 1.16 and 23 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We assessed the appropriateness of the methods used and reviewed the measurement of the hedging assets at market value. 1 We examined the existing procedures for the identiﬁcation, evaluation and presentation in the accounts of Areva’s risks, litigation and contingent liabilities. We also veriﬁed that the main disputes identiﬁed during the implementation of these procedures are described appropriately in the ﬁnancial statements, and in Notes 24 and 34 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in particular. 1 These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the ﬁrst part of this report. III. SPECIFIC VERIFICATION As required by law we have also veriﬁed in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information presented in the Group’s management report. With the exception of the matters described in the ﬁrst part of this report, we have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information speciﬁcally required by French law in such reports, whether modiﬁed or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the ﬁnancial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors’ assessments of certain signiﬁcant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions, or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the speciﬁc veriﬁcation of information given in the management report and in the documents addressed to shareholders.

These ﬁnancial statements have been approved by the Executive Board. Our role is to express an opinion on these ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. I. OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the ﬁnancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2013 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. II. JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: 1 participating interests were valued in accordance with the accounting methods described in the note 2.2 to the ﬁnancial statements entitled “Accounting policies, rules and methods – Long-term investments”. As part of our procedures, we reviewed the appropriateness of these accounting methods and the information provided in the note mentioned above, and assessed the assumptions adopted; 1 with respect to risks, litigations and contingent liabilities, we assessed the procedures currently used by your Company to identify, assess and record such risks, litigations and contingent liabilities in the accounts. We also ascertained that the main litigations identiﬁed by the procedures implemented by your Company are described appropriately in the ﬁnancial statements and speciﬁcally in note 6.8. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the ﬁrst part of this report. 2013 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT 275 FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING ASSETS, 20 FINANCIAL POSITIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 20.3. 20.3.1. 2013 ﬁnancial statements Statutory Auditors’ report on the ﬁnancial statements III.

GLOBAL COMPACT 381 D OUR VALUES 381 Sir, Madam and Colleague, In ten years’ time, we have become a leading player in low-carbon solutions for power generation. In nuclear, the group’s integrated business model has lifted it to ﬁrst place in the global nuclear market. In renewables, its technologies allow us to nurture great ambitions. An acute sense of professionalism at all times is required by the very nature of our businesses and is necessary to maintain our lead. This translates into the application of the highest standards of safety and physical security. In the new post-Fukushima world, the principle of transparency promoted and implemented by the group since its establishment is becoming an even more legitimate and pressing requirement for all companies and operators in the nuclear sector. Against this backdrop, and in line with the best practices we are deploying, our Values Charter serves as a touchstone for our employees as they go about their work. It is distributed in some ﬁfteen languages and training programs in association with AREVA University and the Corporate Business Ethics Advisor. Its application calls for management responsibility, an annual conformity commitment, and ethical reporting. Lessons learned, audit, and a policy of conﬁdentiality and non-retaliation against good faith whistleblowers all go into making the Values Charter a fundamental part of the group’s culture. AREVA’s Executive Management Board asks you to ensure, along with your management, that the Values Charter governs your daily work, both individually and as a community, whether performed for us or with others. One commitment transcends our Values Charter: Human Rights, as deﬁned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. AREVA’s reputation is a precious asset for which we are all responsible, and each of us must guard it. I am certain of your commitment to making a contribution to our group’s performance in this spirit.
