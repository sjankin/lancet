In addition, our internal policy states that:  As an employer, 4C shall work to ensure that no employee is exposed to any form of harassment or offensive conduct on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, political opinion or functional disability. Demeaning attitudes should not be exhibited in any manner, nor harassment because of for example a report of sexual discrimination. Every employee should be watchful for the jargon which is used and whether or not it is suitable at 4C.  The employee who believes themselves to have been subjected to harassment should immediately contact the closest line manager who then, in consultation with HR Manager will analyze the situation, decide about and follow up with necessary actions. Our ambition and goal for the year is to keep our record of no formal complaints or legal breaches in the area of Human Rights intact. We conducted an Employee Satisfaction Survey in February. On the questions related to “harassment” (bullying, sexual harassment, discrimination etc.) 4C Strategies received a score of 4.3 out of a maximum of 5. This is an excellent mark and well above the industry peer average. During 2014, no formal complaint or legal issue related to Human Rights has been received.  Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining (P3)  The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour (P4);  The effective abolition of child labour (P5);  and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation (P6). 4C Strategies fully supports and adheres to the strict laws (of Sweden and UK) pertaining to the freedom of association and labour practices, and actively works to promote equality at the workplace. Our internal policy states: 4C shall work towards both a quantitative and qualitative equality within the company. Women and men should be provided equal opportunity to exert influence on the company's 4C Strategies AB http://www.4cstrategies.com Telefon: +46(0)8-522 279 00 Stockholm info@4cstrategies.com Fax: +46(0)8-20 15 62 2014-12-01 COP 2014 4(5) business and influence their own work situation, there shall be no unjustified salary differences, women and men should have equal opportunities for development, there shall be favorable conditions for combining work and family. Below are listed the areas in which 4C actively promotes gender equality. These areas are defined in the Swedish Equality Act 92-01-01, SFS 1991:433.  4C should have a work organization and environment which is suitable for both women and men. The physical, organizational and psychosocial work environment should cater to both women and men and may not systematically hinder a gender in any way.  In internal and external recruitment the gender equality aspect should always be considered. An applicant of an under-represented gender should therefore be recruited if there are several applicants with equal or equivalent qualifications.  Employees should be able to combine employment with parenthood. Such a need should be accommodated to the highest possible degree. Employees on parental leave should not be overlooked when salaries are revised.  Salary differentiations should be explainable through fact-based and thereby genderneutral reasons. Differences in salary between for example women and men are surveyed yearly and the results are used in the salary revision. Our ambition and goal for the year is to keep our record of no formal complaints or legal breaches in the area of Labour intact. We continuously measure the gender ratio in the company. The average ratio for 2014 was 34% women (up from 30% last year). In our Nordic Management Team the ratio is 45% women (4 out of 9). During 2014, no formal complaint or legal issue related to Labour has been received.  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges (P7).  Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility (P8)  and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies (P9). 4C Strategies’ policy states: 4C shall protect the environment and conserve energy and natural resources as far as possible. We shall accomplish this through: 4C Strategies AB http://www.4cstrategies.com Telefon: +46(0)8-522 279 00 Stockholm info@4cstrategies.com Fax: +46(0)8-20 15 62 2014-12-01 COP 2014 5(5)  motivating employees and partners to behave in an environmentally responsible way.  minimizing our environmental impact at the office.  using, to the extent that is possible, environmentally friendly ways of travel in all of our business trips. 4C Strategies subscribes to a green program run by our landlord, which entails local sorting (paper, cardboard, metal, glass, hazardous) by ourselves, use of 100% green electricity (fossil free production) and energy conservation (heating). 4C Strategies has numerous initiatives to limit staff’s need to travel to work and/or between offices, e.g. phone-meetings, VPN-solutions, Microsoft Lync etc.). Our Stockholm office only uses low-energy light bulbs. When printing paper our standard setting is by default double-sided and black and white. We use 100% fossil free electricity at the Stockholm office.  Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery (P10). 4C Strategies fully supports and adheres to Swedish and UK legislation regarding corruption. 4C Strategies conducts detailed and regular inspection of all company representation; all bills from travels, dinner and drinks, gifts, conferences, fairs, exhibitions have to be approved by the Line Manager as well as the CEO, and must be presented with a legal receipt or else the employee is not reimbursed. 4C Strategies actively works to comply with all our clients’ anti-corruption policies. For instance, when arranging seminars, meetings etc. we always ask our invited client’s if the services we intend to provide (eg. meals, drinks & activities etc.) may be offered free by us or if we rather should charge for them in order to comply with their anti-corruption policies. During 2014, no complaint or legal issue related to Corruption has been received. 4C Strategies AB http://www.4cstrategies.com Telefon: +46(0)8-522 279 00 Stockholm info@4cstrategies.com Fax: +46(0)8-20 15 62
