This milestone allows us to stop and take a moment to reflect on the years that led us here. In 1979, our company integrated its envelope manufacturing capabilities into print and fulfillment services to match the country’s demand for direct mail package production. Through the following three decades, NAC developed an intuitive marketing platform that incorporates each aspect of the direct marketing value chain, including creative and data services, print production and literature/ production fulfillment. In 2007, NAC expanded to include an additional location in El Paso, Texas, twinned with a production facility in Juarez, Mexico. With two regional locations, we have become the largest, international, fully integrated direct mail supplier. As our business continues to grow, so does our responsibility to social good. It is my pleasure to reaffirm NAC’s commitment to the United Nation’s Global Compact. As a proud signatory for the last six years, we promote the integration of the 10 principles in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment, and AntiCorruption, into our business strategy, corporate culture and daily operations. Sincerely, Rob Herman President & COO 2012/13 Communication on Progress iv overview SCOPE The 2012/2013 Communication on Progress encompasses company performance, initiatives and statements for North American Communications (NAC) and its partner companies: North American Mailing Services (NAMS), NAMSdirect and NAC Logistics, LLC.

ISO defines, establishes and maintains a quality assurance system for manufacturing and service industries. ISO 9001 allows organizations to comply with and fulfill the standard. The standard specifies that the organization shall issue and maintain the following six documented procedures: • Control of documents • Control of records • Internal audits • Control of nonconforming product/service • Corrective action • Preventative action ISO 9001 also demands that any other required procedures be documented for effective operation. A quality policy and manual must also be issued along with specific numerous records as specified throughout the standard. *NAMSdirect only 2012/13 Communication on Progress 4 green value In 2013, NAC purchased a custom 10-Color Sanden Web Printing Press in order to satisfy the demands for higher print quality, increased color capacity and faster turnaround times. This new press has also satisfied our corporate goal to integrate environmentally friendly technology into the production process. Equipped with an integrated CC1 automatic camera register control system, the new printing press has reduced our waste while increasing the quality of our products. The register control system fully automates the color registration process instantly. It constantly monitors registration, and makes immediate adjustments in order to prevent unusable, wasteful forms. Instead of registration taking 2-3 minutes as it would when done manually, the Sanden press runs with automatic register control, which takes place in a matter of seconds, increasing quality and decreasing downtime. With the addition of the 10-Color Sanden Web Printing Press, we are seeing less throughput, less electricity and ink usage and a 4% savings in paper. With this decrease in our waste and savings in paper, we are also maximizing productivity and increasing the quality of our printing. 2012/13 Communication on Progress 5 sustainable mail products FROM FOREST TO MAILBOX Saw Mill & Paper Mill NAC continually promotes responsible forest stewardship through Chain-of-Custody (CoC) certifications. We actively participate to educate our associates and customers on environmentally responsible practices. These practices include the usage of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) certified stocks. We challenge ourselves to increase the total amount of CoC certified paper used in mail production every year.

NAC participates in the Shred-it recycling program that helps to regulate shredding and recycling confidential information safely and securely. In addition to greatly reducing information security risks, the shredded paper is repurposed into new paper products. In 2012, Shred-it helped NAC save 20.15 trees from destruction. In 2013, that number rose to 48.09 trees saved. Recycled paper (per ton) can reduce energy consumption by 65%, reduce water consumption by 58%, and generate 60 pounds less air pollution. We are proud to stand behind the Shred-it organization, and excited to continue promoting environmentally responsible business practices. NAC is also taking steps to further improve our carbon footprint. In 2012, 40 light fixtures with 400-watt units were replaced with 200-watt units, creating lower power consumption. Our Water Reuse Program successfully allowed us to recycle 23,000 gallons of water in 2012 and 22,300 gallons in 2013. Furthermore, NAC is proposing water free urinals; a project with the potential to save 40,000 gallons of water per fixture, per year. 2012/13 Communication on Progress 7 DIVERSITY Workplace As an international business, diversity in the workplace is vital to our success. NAC employs men and women of various ages, races, religious affiliations, sexual orientations and nationalities with differing skills, levels of education and experiences. During this report, our total workforce was 42% minorities and 51% women. A diverse workforce fosters creativity, innovation and helps generate new ideas, services and products. Moving forward, NAC will continue to recruit multi-dimensional talent in order to build our business and drive future growth. Supplier As a global leader in the direct mail manufacturing industry, NAC is dedicated to operating our privately held corporation in a responsible, ethical manner. In today’s economy, it is essential to work with stakeholders to effectively bring forth change. We seek to purchase competitively priced, quality goods and services from diverse suppliers who uphold the same values of our corporation. 2013 marked the beginning of our Supplier Diversity Program at NAC, with a projected launch date for the first quarter of 2014. The Supplier Diversity Program will ultimately establish a network of certified diverse suppliers. NAC believes that including more local, small, minority, women and disabled veteran-owned businesses improves the economic stability in our communities. This network of diverse suppliers will serve as a resource to select suppliers to compete for contracting opportunities. 2012/13 Communication on Progress 8 community Local Economic Development NAC is committed to creating and maintaining a positive and significant impact on our communities. We feel one of the best assessments of a company’s success is their contribution to local economic growth. In 2012, 18 full-time jobs were created at NAC, and an additional 27 new associates were hired in 2013. This gives us a 33% increase in job creation over those two years.* NAC makes a substantial effort to purchase products and services from local and small businesses. We are not only creating and retaining jobs at our facilities, but indirectly generating opportunity and income for businesses throughout the community. Global Community NAC has a long-standing history of charitable investments. Each year, associates invest their time, energy and resources to both our immediate and global communities.
