Implementation and certification of a management system is a process that takes some time, which means that Swedfund’s efforts to exert an influence do not achieve quick results. Experience also tells us that the smaller companies have bigger problems than the medium-sized or larger ones in building knowledge about the management system that is needed for implementing it. As far as Swedfund is concerned, systematic work on the environment, health and safety are essential. Observing legal requirements at a minimum, striving for continuous improvement, reducing the environmental impact and improving the working environment are central issues for a sustainable business. 62 | s w e d f u n d ’ s i n t e g r a t e d r e p o r t 2 0 1 3 reporting of development results sustainability “We encourage PRI signatories and non-signatories, to both monitor, and engage on, the ESG performance of the companies in which they invest, and to publicly report their activities each year.
