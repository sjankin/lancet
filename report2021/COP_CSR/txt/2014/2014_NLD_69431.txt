Internal management reporting within NIBC is based on IFRS. Segment reporting under IFRS 8 requires a presentation of the segment results based on management reporting methods and a reconciliation between the results of the operating segments and the consolidated financial statements. The items displayed under ‘consolidation effects’ refer to the non-financial entities over which NIBC has control. IFRS requires NIBC to consolidate these entities. The internal management report differs from this, as the investments in these entities are non-strategic and the activities of these entities are nonfinancial. Therefore, in the income statement of NIBC, only NIBC’s share in the net result of these entities is included in the line-item ‘gains less losses from financial assets’. Subsequently, under ‘consolidation effects’ this is eliminated and replaced by the figures of these entities used in the consolidated financial statements.

The number of FTEs (excluding the non-financial companies included in the consolidation) decreased from 627 at 31 December 2012 to 596 at 31 December 2013. The number of FTEs employed outside of the Netherlands decreased from 126 at 31 December 2012 to 104 at 31 December 2013. At 31 December 2013, 106 FTEs (2012: 106 FTEs) were employed at the non-financial companies included in the consolidation, all of them are employed in the Netherlands. The decrease in variable compensation is mainly explained by a further reduction of the variable compensation pool available for employees combined with a lower level of expenses related to share-based payment plans from previous years. Information on the pension charges is included in note 39 Employee benefits. Information on the remuneration of the members of the Managing Board and Supervisory Board can be found in note 52.

The additional amount for 2013 is nil (2012: EUR 0.4 million). In accordance with NIBC’s accounting policies for share-based compensation, this amount has been credited to other reserves. 3 The forfeiture in 2013 relates fully to non-vested long-term deferred compensation granted to Mr. Kees van Dijkhuizen in previous years. Mr. Kees van Dijkhuizen stepped down as member of the Statutory Board on 30 April 2013 and his employment ended at the same date. The forfeiture in 2012 relates fully to non-vested long-term deferred compensation granted to Mr. Jeroen van Hessen in previous years. Mr. Jeroen van Hessen stepped down as member of the Statutory Board on 1 June 2012 and his employment ended at 31 December 2012. In 2013 the government imposed a crisis levy of 16% on salaries of employees exceeding EUR 150,000 per annum. This one-off levy on employers is not part of the remuneration of the Statutory Board as presented in note 53 or in the previous table. The total crisis levy included in the personnel expenses amounts to EUR 1.1 million (2012: EUR 1.4 million) of which EUR 0.2 million (2012: EUR 0.4 million) relates to current and former members of the Statutory Board. The total number of options on NIBC Holding Common Depositary Receipts (CDRs) held by the current and former members of the Statutory Board amounted to nil (vested) as at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: 267,056 (vested)). As at 31 December 2013, current and former members of the Statutory Board held 293,876 CDRs (31 December 2012: 282,990), nil Restricted Depositary Receipts (RDRs) (31 December 2012: nil), 196,206 Conditional Common Depositary Receipts (CCDRs) (31 December 2012: 146,272) and 36,186 Conditional Restricted Depositary Receipts (CRDRs) (31 December 2012: 70,395).

In addition to this, variable compensation can consist of a discretionary short-term cash bonus. NIBC Choice is only open to management and employees and contains conditions relating to termination of employment or certain corporate events, such as restructurings, affecting the rights that would otherwise accrue to them. Depositary receipts The Depositary Receipts (DRs), consisting of CDRs and RDRs, are issued by Stichting Administratiekantoor NIBC Holding (the Foundation) in accordance with its relevant conditions of administration (administratievoorwaarden). The Foundation issues a DR for each ordinary share it holds in NIBC Holding. The Foundation exercises the voting rights in respect of each of these ordinary shares at its own discretion, while the holder of a DR is entitled to the dividends and other distributions declared payable in respect of the underlying ordinary share. Holders of DRs cannot exercise voting rights or request a power of attorney from the Foundation to vote in respect of our ordinary shares. Under the conditions of administration, the holders of DRs have pre-emption rights similar to other shareholders of NIBC Holding, subject to the Foundation having been given pre-emptive rights. Consequently, when given these pre-emptive rights, the Foundation will exercise the pre-emption rights attached to the ordinary shares underlying the DRs if these holders so elect. RDRs cannot be transferred, and are subject to specific vesting rules. Up to 1 January 2008, they were subject to five-year vesting with one fifth vesting on 1 January of each year. In 2008, the vesting schedule was changed to three-year vesting, with one third vesting each year on 1 January, to better align with vesting practices in other financial institutions. In 2012 the vesting date of newly granted instruments was changed to 1 April to be in line with the remuneration guidelines of DNB. Additionally, RDRs are subject to certain conditions including the forfeiture of the RDR in the case of termination of employment, or in the case of certain corporate events, such as restructurings. On every vesting date, the applicable tranche of RDRs converts automatically into CDRs if the vesting conditions are met. In 2013, no new RDRs were granted by NIBC Holding. Instead, the 2012 short-term deferred compensation was delivered in the form of a deferred cash bonus and Restricted Phantom Share Units (RPSUs), both subject to three-year vesting, the first such vesting to occur on 1 April 2014. In 2009, Statutory Board members made a combined personal investment of EUR 1.7 million (184,000 NIBC CDRs at a price of EUR 9.25). In relation to that co-investment the Statutory Board members were granted 184,000 matching shares (CRDRs) on a net after-tax basis representing a 1:1 match. Furthermore, the Statutory Board members are entitled to earn additional performance shares (CRDRs). The number of performance shares contained in this one-off variable compensation is in principle uncapped, but the Supervisory Board has the discretion to adjust the ultimate number in the case of unfair or unintended effects. For determining the number of performance shares, a specific formula will be applied by the Supervisory Board upon a change of control. Therefore the conditions attached to the performance shares are recognised as vesting conditions. The matching shares were awarded in 2009 to the Statutory Board with an underlying fair value of EUR 9.25, which was determined by the Supervisory Board, based on an agreed price-to-book ratio observed in the market at grant date based on net asset value. The number of performance shares will be Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 93 calculated upon a change of control or any other liquidity event as a percentage of the number of matching shares that represents one year’s net base salary at the time of grant, using a pre-agreed formula. The terms and conditions applicable to these CRDRs are in line with those applicable to the 2008 RDRs, except for the calculation of the fair value at grant date, the vesting period and certain performance conditions. The CRDRs (matching shares) which were awarded to the Statutory Board members in 2009 in relation to their co-investment in NIBC are subject to four-year vesting with one quarter vesting each year, for the first time on 1 January 2010 and will become fully unconditional and vest immediately upon change of control of NIBC Holding. The conditional performance shares will vest immediately upon a change of control or any other liquidity event. NIBC has the discretion to offer new members of the Statutory Board the opportunity to participate in this co-investment programme under the same conditions, except for the ability to earn performance shares as this feature is presumed no longer to be in line with the current DNB Principles. This offer was made to Mr. Herman Dijkhuizen when he joined the Statutory Board on 1 October 2013 and it was accepted by him in December 2013 at a price of EUR 8.33 per CDR being the fair value at that time. The CRDRs (matching shares) are subject to a four-year vesting with one quarter vesting each year, for the first time on 1 January 2015. On 30 April 2013, Mr. Kees van Dijkhuizen stepped down from the Statutory Board and his employment ended at the same time. All non-vested instruments, options and CRDRs (related to the co-investment and long-term incentive programmes) were forfeited on 30 April 2013. In 2009, a Long-Term Incentive plan (LTI) was introduced for the Statutory Board members and selected senior management. The LTI is forward-looking and will be granted annually. Its main objective is to provide an incentive to achieve a balanced mix of pre-agreed long-term financial and non-financial performance conditions. The LTI is subject to three-year cliff vesting and an additional retention period of two years and will be delivered in the form of CRDRs but, at the discretion of the Supervisory Board, may be delivered in another form. In response to social developments and further regulatory changes, the Supervisory Board decided to further amend the Remuneration Policy for the Statutory Board in early 2012. As of 1 January 2012, if any LTI is conditionally granted to the Statutory Board, this will be in the form of 66.67% CRDRs and 33.33% cash. The LTI is conditional upon the achievement of performance conditions, is forward-looking and is subject to a three-year performance period and an additional three-year pro-rated deferral period. The Supervisory Board has agreed a set of six long-term performance conditions. Two are financial performance conditions and have a weight of 60% (average return on equity and average impairment level). Four are non-financial performance conditions and have a weight of 40% (employee engagement, client satisfaction for corporate as well as consumer clients and diversity). These are aligned with the overall corporate targets. The final LTI award value depends on the degree to which the agreed performance criteria have been met. On every vesting date, the applicable tranche of CRDRs converts automatically into CCDRs if the vesting conditions are met. Phantom Share Units In 2010, a new equity-linked reward instrument was introduced as part of the Short-Term Incentive (STI) plan for the Statutory Board members and selected senior management. The short-term compensation in share related awards consists of Phantom Share Units (PSUs) and/or RPSUs. RPSU awards are subject to a three-year vesting with one third vesting each year. All PSUs, whether vested or restricted are subject to a five-year retention period as measured from the date of grant. In 2012, as part of the review of the remuneration policies against the remuneration guidelines of DNB, it was decided to shorten the retention period from a five-year period to a one-year period and to move the vesting date from 1 January to 1 April. 94 Notes to the consolidated financial statements The (R)PSU has similar characteristics as the CRDR used for the LTI, such as eligibility for dividend and a value which is tied to movements in the net asset value of NIBC Holding, however from 2012 newly granted RPSUs are not eligible for dividend. This short-term compensation can be converted into cash immediately after the retention period and therefore is recognised as cash-settled. Stock Options NIBC Choice also comprises an employee Option Plan which allowed NIBC Holding to grant options to members of its Statutory Board and employees up to a maximum of 5% of its share capital as at 14 December 2005 on a fully diluted basis. The Option Plan was introduced with the intention of further enhancing the attractiveness of converting accumulated rights under the legacy plans into NIBC Choice by granting options to employees who converted their entitlements into DRs. In addition, options were granted to encourage investment of own funds by employees in CDRs and as part of the compensation of senior management and other employees. NIBC may decide to grant further options under the current Option Plan. Each option gives the option holder the right to be issued one CDR. The options are only exercisable by the option holder. Of the options granted on a certain date, 50% vest after three years and the remainder vest after four years from the date of grant and the options granted in 2005 and 2006 have a seven-year exercise period with a possibility for a three-year extension in the case a liquidity event has not yet taken place before the end of the seven-year period, provided that such a period will end no later than 14 December 2015. In 2012, the Statutory Board, after consultation with the Supervisory Board, decided to apply this three-year extension. As a general rule, all unvested and vested out of the money options shall be forfeited for no consideration upon termination of employment of an option holder. However, vested options are exercisable during open periods, provided that the option holder is still employed by NIBC or, if no longer employed by NIBC, during the next open period following termination. An open period generally is the 21-day period following the date of approval of the annual, semi-annual or quarterly results, taking into account NIBC’s internal regulations on private investment transactions. The exercise price of an option is equal to the fair market value of a DR at the date of grant as defined and calculated in accordance with the conditions of administration of the Foundation. This fair market value is based on the changes in NIBC Holding’s net asset value, calculated using a fixed formula, relative to the exercise price of EUR 18.25, which was determined when NIBC first introduced the Option Plan in December 2005. Any dividends payable are deducted from the exercise price of an option. The Statutory Board may permit a cashless exercise, allowing the holder to convert his options into fewer CDRs than he would otherwise be entitled to, while not having to pay the exercise price. Upon the occurrence of certain corporate events, such as capital adjustments, payment of stock dividends, an issue of shares or recapitalisations, the Statutory Board, following consultation with the Supervisory Board, may adjust the number of options and/or the exercise price as is equitable to reflect the event. In 2012 and 2013, no new options were granted to employees. Stock option and share plans Options As at year-end 2013, 1,928,187 options (2012: 2,458,592) on CDRs of NIBC Holding were in issue, with a weighted average remaining vesting period of nil years (2012: nil years). Of this total position, 1,928,187 options were vested at 31 December 2013. A requirement for vesting at the vesting date is that the holder is still employed by NIBC Holding or one of its group companies. The weighted average exercise period of the options is 2.0 years (2012: 3.0 years). All options in issue as at 31 December 2013 and as at 31 December 2012 are equity-settled instruments.

In 2013, 208,750 options were exercised into CDRs. All option holders opted for the cashless exercise. As a consequence, the holder converted his options into fewer CDRs than he would otherwise be entitled to, while not having to pay the exercise price. At year-end the conversion of 28,400 exercised options into 5,085 CDRs was still pending. Common Depositary Receipts As at year end 2013, 2,581,404 (2012: 2,775,057) CDRs were issued to employees. Of the position as at year end 2013, 6,303 which is 0.2% of CDRs are considered cash-settled (2012: 9,191 and 0.3%); the remaining 99.8% is considered equity-settled. In the case an employee has the right to demand cash settlement against their fair value, the CDRs are considered cash-settled (as opposed to equity-settled). In 2013, a fully discretionary offer was made to current and former employees to sell their CDR holdings to a certain threshold with a maximum of 10%. Main reason was to reduce administrative and handling expenses by reducing the number of (small) holders of CDRs. Statutory Board members were not eligible for this offer.

Of the position as at year-end 2013, no CCDRs were considered cash-settled (2012: nil), but all CCDRs were considered equity-settled. At year-end 2013, 19,459 (2012: 24,648) CCDRs were in issue to Statutory Board members related to the LTI scheme for the performance year 2010 for which the three-year cliff vesting period ended 1 January 2013. The Supervisory Board reviewed the agreed long-term financial and non-financial performance conditions. The financial performance conditions (60%) were not met. The non-financial performance conditions (40%) were met in full. The Supervisory Board therefore awarded a vesting of 40% of the LTI 2010 CRDRs, which have fully vested into CCDRs at 1 January 2013. Consequently 60% of the LTI 2010 forfeited. The vested instruments have an additional retention period of two years. Furthermore the vested instruments need to be held until a liquidity event takes place to ensure alignment with the shareholders.

Conditional Restricted Depositary Receipts At year-end 2013, 45,977 CRDRs (2012: 92,519) were in issue to employees, including 30,939 CRDRs (2012: 55,080) which were in issue to Statutory Board members related to their personal co-investment in 2012 and 2013 in NIBC Holding CDRs, with a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.9 years (2012: 0.5 years). These CRDRs are subject to four-year vesting with one quarter vesting each year on 1 January, for the first time on 1 January 2013 (2012 investment) and 1 January 2015 (2013 investment) provided that the holder is still employed by NIBC prior to the vesting date. These CRDRs will become fully unconditional and vest immediately upon change of control of NIBC Holding. The number of performance shares is dependent on certain performance targets, and will be calculated upon a change of control event as a percentage of the number of matching shares that represents one year’s net base salary at the time of grant. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 97 For reporting purposes, the number of performance shares for the combined Statutory Board is estimated at nil CRDRs, based on NIBC’s long-term forecast and taking into account price-to-book ratios observed in the market. Depending on the assumptions applied, this number can vary over time. The conditional performance shares will vest immediately upon a change of control of NIBC Holding. Of the position as at year-end 2013, no CRDRs were considered cash-settled (2012: nil), but all CRDRs were considered equity-settled. The three-year performance period of a total of 38,890 CRDRs under the LTI 2011 ended 1 January 2014. The Supervisory Board reviewed the agreed long-term financial and non-financial performance conditions. The financial performance conditions (60%) were not met. The non-financial performance conditions (40%) were almost met at stretch level. The Supervisory Board therefore awarded a vesting of 38% of the LTI 2011 CRDRs, which will fully vest at 1 April 2014 in line with the interim re-measurement done at year-end 2012. Consequently 62% of the LTI 2011 forfeited. The vested instruments have an additional retention period of two years. Furthermore the vested instruments need to be held until a liquidity event takes place to ensure alignment with the shareholders. At year-end 2013, 5,247 (2012: 15,315) CRDRs were in issue to Statutory Board members related to the LTI scheme for the performance year 2011, with an estimated weighted average remaining vesting period of nil years (2012: 0.5 years).

With respect to all instruments relating to NIBC Choice (CDRs, RDRs, CCDRs, CRDRs, options PSUs, RPSUs and deferred cash), an amount of EUR 2 million was expensed through personnel expenses in 2013 (2012: EUR 2 million), of which EUR 2 million (2012: EUR 2 million) refers to cash-settled instruments (deferred cash and vested PSUs) and nil (2012: nil) to equity-settled instruments. With respect to the cashsettled instruments, the amount expensed during the vesting period through the income statement is based on the number of instruments originally granted outstanding at balance sheet date, their fair value at balance sheet date, the vesting period and estimates of the number of instruments that will be forfeited during the remaining vesting period. The liability in the balance sheet with respect to cash-settled instruments is EUR 4 million (2012: EUR 5 million). With respect to the equity-settled instruments (CDRs, RDRs, CCDRs, CRDRs and options), the amount expensed during the vesting period through the income statement is based on the number of instruments granted outstanding at balance sheet date, their fair value at grant date, the vesting period and estimates of the number of instruments that will be forfeited during the remaining vesting period. In the current account position with NIBC Holding, an amount of EUR 30 million payable is included (2012: EUR 32 million) relating to NIBC Choice. This is a result of recharges from NIBC Holding to its subsidiaries with respect to NIBC Choice (equity-settled instruments). The recharge is accounted for upon vesting of the granted equity settled NIBC Choice instruments. In view of IFRS 2, NIBC has a receivable in the current account position with NIBC Holding for the capital contribution of EUR 51 million (2012: EUR 50 million) in relation to the share-based payments programme granted by NIBC Holding.

Securitised residential mortgages are recognised on NIBC’s balance sheet based on the risks and rewards NIBC retains in the SPEs issuing the mortgage-backed notes. Risks and rewards can be retained by NIBC by retaining issued notes, providing overcollateralisation to the SPEs or implementing reserve accounts in the SPEs.

Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 115 Fair value hedges of interest rate risk The following table discloses the fair value of the swaps designated in fair value hedging relationships: IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 Fair value pay fixed swaps (hedging assets) assets 1 Fair value pay fixed swaps (hedging assets) liabilities (13) (20) (12) (20) Fair value pay floating swaps (hedging liabilities) assets 138 275 Fair value pay floating swaps (hedging liabilities) liabilities (2) 136 275 Cash flow hedges of interest rate risk The following table discloses the fair value of the swaps designated in cash flow hedging relationships: IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 Fair value receive fixed swaps assets Fair value receive fixed swaps liabilities Fair value receive floating swaps assets 2 Fair value receive floating swaps liabilities (2) Sum of fair value and cash flow hedges of interest rate risk IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 Fair value pay swaps assets 139 275 Fair value receive swaps assets 2 141 275 Fair value pay swaps liabilities (15) (20) Fair value receive swaps liabilities (2) (17) (20) The average remaining maturity (in which the related cash flows are expected to enter into the determination of profit or loss) is three years (2012: four years). 116 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Hedging activities Portfolio fair value hedge of plain vanilla funding According to NIBC’s Hedging Policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its fixed rate plain vanilla funding activities above certain limits prescribed by the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO). Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising on this fixed rate funding. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the fixed rate plain vanilla funding and corresponding hedging transactions. The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question. The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these relationships at 31 December 2013 was EUR 15 million debit (2012: EUR 20 million debit). The losses on the hedging instruments were EUR 8 million (2012: loss of EUR 1 million). The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 8 million (2012: EUR 1 million). Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by hedge ineffectiveness. Portfolio fair value hedge of fixed rate retail deposits According to NIBC’s Hedging Policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its fixed rate retail deposit activities above certain limits prescribed by the ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising on this fixed rate funding. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the retail deposits with a contractual duration longer than two years and the corresponding hedging transactions. The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question. The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these relationships at 31 December 2013 was EUR 69 million debit (2012: EUR 108 million debit). The losses on the hedging instruments were EUR 39 million (2012: gain of EUR 44 million). The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 41 million (2012: loss of EUR 40 million). Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by hedge ineffectiveness. Micro fair value hedge of plain vanilla funding According to NIBC’s hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange risk from its fixed rate plain vanilla funding activities above certain limits prescribed by ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk arising on this fixed rate funding. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a micro fair value hedge for fixed rate plain vanilla funding and corresponding hedging transactions. The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question. The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these relationships at 31 December 2013 was EUR 48 million debit (2012: EUR 144 million debit). The losses on the hedging instruments were EUR 42 million (2012: loss of EUR 10 million). The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 41 million (2012: gain of EUR 11 million). Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by hedge ineffectiveness. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 117 Portfolio fair value hedge of loans According to NIBC’s hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its corporate loan activities above certain limits as set by ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising from these fixed rate loans. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the fixed rate loan and corresponding hedging transactions. The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question. The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these hedge relationships at 31 December 2013 was EUR 5 million credit (2012: EUR 11 million credit). Gains on the hedging instruments were EUR 4 million (2012: nil). The losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 2 million (2012: gain of EUR 3 million). Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by hedge ineffectiveness. Micro fair value hedge of the Liquidity portfolio debt investments According to NIBC’s hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to fair value interest rate risk from its fixed rate debt investments held in the Liquidity portfolios above certain limits prescribed by ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising on this fixed rate debt investments. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a micro fair value hedge for fixed rate debt investments and corresponding hedging transactions. The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question. The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these relationships at 31 December 2013 was EUR 3 million credit (2012: EUR 6 million credit). The gains on the hedging instruments were EUR 2 million (2012: gain of EUR 2 million). The loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk was EUR 1 million (2012: loss of EUR 3 million). Cash flow hedges NIBC has classified a large part of its corporate loans as loans and receivable at amortised cost. Therefore, variability in the cash flows of the floating rate corporate loans is accounted for in future periods, when the coupons are recorded in the income statement on an amortised cost basis. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the floating cash flows of its floating corporate loans. These swaps are reported at fair value through profit or loss. This accounting mismatch creates volatility in the income statement of NIBC. Therefore NIBC applies hedge accounting on these positions. Hedge accounting is applied to all swaps that are used to hedge the cash flow risk of the floating corporate loans by defining a macro cash flow hedge relationship with the floating corporate loans. The variability in interest cash flows arising on floating rate corporate loans is hedged on a portfolio basis with interest rate swaps that receive fixed and pay floating (generally one, three and six months floating rates). The highly probable cash flows being hedged relate both to the highly probable cash flows on outstanding corporate loans and to the future reinvestment of these cash flows. NIBC does not hedge the variability of future cash flows of corporate loans arising from changes in credit spreads. New hedging relations were started in 2013. Interest rate swaps with a net fair value of nil (2012: nil) were designated in a cash flow hedge relationship. The cash flow on the hedged item will be reported in income over the next nine years. In 2013 and 2012, the ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arose from cash flow hedges was nil. 118 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Some macro cash flow hedging relationships ceased to exist during 2011 and therefore the related cumulative hedge adjustment as from that date is being amortised over the remaining contractual maturity of the hedged item. The amount that was recognised in equity for the years 2013 and 2012 was nil. The amount that was transferred from equity to the income statement in 2013 was a gain of EUR 28 million net of tax (2012: gain of EUR 29 million). Net investment hedge NIBC hedges part of the currency translation risk arising on its net investments in foreign operations by using foreign currency debt as a hedging instrument. Debt amounting to USD 101 million (2012: USD 211 million) was designated as a hedging instrument, and gave rise to a currency loss for the year 2013 of EUR 6 million before tax (2012: gain of EUR 3 million), which was recognised in the translation reserve component of equity. No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement arising from hedges of net investments in foreign operations. In 2013 there was a partial unwinding of the net investment hedge as a consequence of the partial disposal of NIBC Services Ltd. (2012: nil).

After derecognition in 2011, NIBC recognised goodwill to an amount of EUR 32 million (2012: EUR 32 million) and other intangible assets to an amount of EUR 15 million (2012: EUR 18 million) on the acquisition of business combinations. The remaining amortisation period for the categories trademarks and licences is six years, for customer relationships and other intangibles three years. Intangible assets pledged as security for liabilities were nil for both 2013 and 2012. Goodwill acquired in business combinations is reviewed in the fourth quarter of the respective financial year for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairments may have occurred, by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which goodwill has been allocated with its carrying amount.

As NIBC hedges its interest rate risk from these liabilities, the movement due to interest rate changes is compensated by results on financial derivatives. The portion of fair value changes during 2013 and 2012 attributable to the movement in credit spreads amounted to nil. The contractual amounts of these liabilities to be repaid at maturity, including unpaid but accrued interest at the balance sheet date, amounted to EUR 36 million at 31 December 2013 (2012: EUR 35 million). 37 Debt securities in issue structured (designated at fair value through profit or loss) IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 Bonds and notes issued 794 1,654 794 1,654 THE LEGAL MATURITY ANALYSIS OF DEBT SECURITIES IN ISSUE STRUCTURED IS AS FOLLOWS: Three months or less 4 Longer than three months but not longer than one year 45 690 Longer than one year but not longer than five years 217 307 Longer than five years 528 657 794 1,654 The fair value reflects movements due to both interest rate changes and credit spread changes. As NIBC hedges its interest rate risk from these liabilities, the movement due to interest rate changes is compensated by results on financial derivatives. The portion of fair value changes during 2013 attributable to the movement in credit spreads amounted to EUR 10 million credit, being an increase of the carrying amount (2012: EUR 12 million debit, being a reduction of the carrying amount). In 2013, gains of EUR 1 million (2012: gain of EUR 4 million) were realised on the repurchase of liabilities with respect to this balance sheet item. The contractual amounts of these liabilities to be repaid at maturity, including unpaid but accrued interest at the balance sheet date, amounted to EUR 873 million at 31 December 2013 (2012: EUR 1,671 million).

The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies, on the basis of contractually agreed tariff rates, or separate trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. NIBC has both defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans. A defined-benefit plan is a plan where the rules specify the benefits to be paid to the members at retirement. These benefits will depend on the number of years of service, the final salary (up to a maximum) upon retirement and the accrual rate of the scheme. Most of the pension plans are definedbenefit plans based on a maximised final pay salary and are funded. A defined-contribution plan is a pension plan under which NIBC each year pays a fixed percentage of the salaries of the members into the scheme. The size of the fund on retirement will be determined by how much was contributed to the scheme and the investment return achieved. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined-benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined-benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The definedbenefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The latest actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 December 2013. The present value of the definedbenefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The assets of the funded plans are held independently of NIBC’s assets in separate trustee administered funds. Actuarial gains and losses arise from the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets for a period, from experience adjustments on liabilities or from changes in the actuarial assumptions used to determine the defined-benefit obligation. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and will not be reclassified subsequently to the income statement. They are recognised in retained earnings. For defined-contribution plans, NIBC pays contributions directly into the member’s scheme. NIBC has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. 128 Notes to the consolidated financial statements IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CAN BE CATEGORISED AS FOLLOWS: Present value of funded obligations 247 242 Fair value of plan assets 235 232 DEFICIT FOR FUNDED PLANS 12 10 Subordinated loan to trustee-administered fund 1 (3) (3) 9 7 1 NIBC has advanced a subordinated loan (interest charge: 0%) for an amount of EUR 3 million (2012: EUR 3 million) to the trusteeadministered fund (NIBC’s Pension Fund). There will be no repayment of this loan until the fund has reached a solvency ratio of 150%. Based on the current funding level of the pension fund, the contribution level is limited to the current pension accrual only. A minimum funding obligation is therefore not recognised. According to the administration agreement between NIBC and the pension fund, surpluses in the plan will become available to NIBC during gradual settlement of the liabilities. As a consequence, the financial surplus in the plan needs not to be reduced because of a limit on net assets. The pension plan is currently not in a deficit position. If the funding ratio were to fall below the minimum required level (a funding ratio of around 105%, measured according to local legislation), the pension plan would officially have a funding deficit. In that case a short-term recovery plan would have to be drawn up to eliminate the deficit within three years. If the funding ratio is above the minimum level but below the required solvency level, there would be a solvency deficit, in which case a long-term plan would have to be drawn up for recovery within 15 years. In the event of a deficit position NIBC has a payment obligation to NIBC’s pension fund, payable in the year after identification. At 31 December 2013, the coverage ratio of the pension fund as determined by DNB was 113.3%. To comply with the legislative fiscal changes NIBC decided to amend the defined-benefit plan as per 1 January 2014. As a consequence of the increase of the formal retirement age from 65 years to 67 years the accrual rate as from 1 January 2014 will change from 1.75 into 1.63. This change has a direct effect on the defined-benefit obligation at 31 December 2013, which is accounted for as a past service gain in the income statement in 2013. The measurement date for this change is 31 December 2013. For the regulatory framework in which the defined plan operates and the ALM-strategy, included in the ‘Actuariele en bedrijfstechnische nota’, reference is made to the website of NIBC’s Pension fund (www.pensioenfonds-nibc.nl). The weighted average duration of the defined-benefit obligation is approximately 22 years. At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, the defined-benefit pension asset was reported under Other assets (see note 30 Other assets). NIBC expects to pay an employer contribution of EUR 5.5 million to the defined-benefit pension plan for 2014.

The figures for the years 2009 2011 are based upon IAS 19 Employee Benefits as applicable until the end of 2011. IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised) IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised) requires that actuarial gains and losses arising from defined-benefit pension schemes are recognised in full. Previously NIBC deferred these over the remaining average service lives of the employees (the ‘corridor’ approach). Retrospectively as of 1 January 2012, in accordance with amendments to IAS 19, the balance sheet will fully reflect the pension liability or asset, including any previously unrecognised actuarial losses or gains. As of 1 January 2012 NIBC no longer recognises the amortisation of unrecognised actuarial gains or losses. The amendment to IAS 19 has an insignificant impact on the financial position of NIBC.

These obligations are short-term in nature and therefore valued at nominal value. In 2013, EUR 1 million was related to employee benefit obligations of the non-financial companies included in the consolidation (2012: EUR 1 million). 40 Subordinated liabilities amortised cost IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 Subordinated loans qualifying as Tier-1 capital 44 46 Other subordinated loans 13 37 57 83 THE LEGAL MATURITY ANALYSIS OF SUBORDINATED LIABILITIES IS AS FOLLOWS: One year or less 25 Longer than one year but not longer than five years 1 Longer than five years but not longer than ten years Longer than ten years 56 58 57 83 All of the above loans are subordinated to the other liabilities of NIBC.

Interest expense of EUR 4 million was recognised on subordinated liabilities during the year 2013 (2012: EUR 5 million). In 2013 and 2012, no gains or losses were realised on the repurchase of liabilities with respect to this balance sheet item. 132 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 41 Subordinated liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 Subordinated loans qualifying as Tier-1 capital 133 144 Other subordinated loans 108 120 241 264 THE LEGAL MATURITY ANALYSIS OF SUBORDINATED LIABILITIES IS AS FOLLOWS: One year or less 21 Longer than one year but not longer than five years 15 40 Longer than five year but not longer than ten years Longer than ten years 205 224 241 264 The fair value reflects movements due to both interest rate changes and credit spread changes. As NIBC hedges its interest rate risk from these liabilities, the movement due to interest rate changes is compensated by results on financial derivatives. The contractual amounts of these liabilities to be repaid at maturity, including unpaid but accrued interest at the balance sheet date, amounted to EUR 375 million at 31 December 2013 (2012: EUR 388 million). The portion of fair value changes during 2013 attributable to the movement in credit spreads amounted to nil (2012: EUR 29 million debit). All of the above loans are subordinated to the other liabilities of NIBC. EUR 133 million (2012: EUR 144 million) qualifying as Tier-1 capital is subordinated to other subordinated loans. These securities are perpetual securities and may be redeemed by NIBC at its option after ten years with the prior approval of the DNB. Interest expense of EUR 17 million was recognised on subordinated liabilities during the year 2013 (2012: EUR 20 million). In 2013, no gains or losses were realised on the repurchase of liabilities with respect to this balance sheet item (2012: loss of EUR 4 million). NIBC has not had any defaults of principal, interest or redemption amounts during either 2013 or 2012 on its liabilities.

Hedging reserve This reserve comprises the portion of the gains or losses on hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge (net of tax) as well as the net investment hedge effect on foreign entities (net of tax). Revaluation reserve equity investments (available-for-sale) This reserve comprises changes in fair value of available-for-sale equity investments (net of tax). Revaluation reserve debt investments (available-for-sale) NIBC recognised in the revaluation reserve in equity a total fair value loss of EUR 1 million on financial assets reclassified out of the available-for-sale category into the loans and receivables category related to debt investments reclassified as per 1 July 2008. Revaluation reserve financial assets reclassified into available-for-sale category In 2013 and 2012, no transfers to impairment expense with a fair value loss were recognised in the revaluation reserve in shareholder’s equity on financial assets reclassified out of trading into the available-for-sale category. NIBC chose to reclassify (as of 1 July 2008) certain financial assets that were no longer held for the purpose of selling in the near term as permitted by the amendment to lAS 39 and IFRS 7. In NIBC’s judgement, the deterioration in the world’s financial markets was an example of a rare circumstance applicable on the date of reclassification. Had NIBC determined that the market conditions during 2008 did not represent a rare Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 135 circumstance or that NIBC did not have the intention and ability to hold the financial assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity, and had NIBC therefore not reclassified the financial assets, a net of tax gain of EUR 18 million (2012: net of tax gain of EUR 36 million) would have been recognised in the income statement and an incremental net of tax gain of EUR 24 million (2012: net of tax gain of EUR 5 million) would have been recognised in the revaluation reserve in equity in 2013 due to changes in fair value. For all reclassifications, the reason for applying the amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 is alignment to best market practice. For more details, see notes 2, 5, 11, 15, 16 and 19. Revaluation reserve property, plant and equipment This reserve comprises changes in fair value of land and buildings (net of tax). Retained earnings Retained earnings reflect accumulated earnings less dividends accrued and paid to shareholders and transfers from other reserves. Remeasurements of defined-benefit plans Remeasurements of defined-benefit plans recognised immediately in other comprehensive income comprises actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). 136 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 43 Fair value of financial instruments IFRS 7 requires specific disclosures for financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the balance sheet. The disclosure of each class of financial assets and liabilities within a three-level hierarchy, referring to the respective basis of fair value measurement is as follows: nn Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (level 1); nn Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) (level 2); and nn Inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (level 3). For an explanation of the fair value measurement hierarchy, reference is made to the accounting policies section on fair value estimation. The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Fair value of financial instruments at 31 December 2013 IN EUR MILLIONS Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2013 FINANCIAL ASSETS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE Equity investments (unlisted) 47 47 Debt investments 1,297 3 1,300 1,297 50 1,347 FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS (INCLUDING TRADING) Loans 480 480 Residential mortgages own book 3,586 3,586 Securitised residential mortgages 3,878 3,878 Debt investments 81 81 Equity investments (including investments in associates) 257 257 Derivative financial assets 2,800 2,800 10,825 257 11,082 12,122 307 12,429 IN EUR MILLIONS Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2013 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS (INCLUDING TRADING) Own debt securities in issue 35 35 Debt securities in issue structured 794 794 Derivative financial liabilities 2,957 2,957 Subordinated liabilities 241 241 4,027 4,027 Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 137 Fair value of financial instruments at 31 December 2012 IN EUR MILLIONS Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2012 FINANCIAL ASSETS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE Equity investments (unlisted) 49 49 Debt investments 981 4 985 981 53 1,034 FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS (INCLUDING TRADING) Loans 515 515 Residential mortgages own book 3,675 3,675 Securitised residential mortgages 4,512 4,512 Debt investments 124 124 Equity investments (including investments in associates) 215 215 Derivative financial assets 3,917 3,917 12,743 215 12,958 13,724 268 13,992 IN EUR MILLIONS Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2012 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS (INCLUDING TRADING) Own debt securities in issue 34 34 Debt securities in issue structured 1,654 1,654 Derivative financial liabilities 4,046 4,046 Subordinated liabilities 264 264 5,998 5,998 Financial instruments recorded at fair value The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments that are recorded at fair value using either quoted prices or valuation techniques. These incorporate NIBC’s interpretation of valuation assumptions (qualitative) that a market participant would consider when valuing the instruments. Financial assets available-for-sale Equity investments (unlisted) level 3 The fair value of investments in equity funds is determined based on the net asset value reported by the managers of these funds. These net asset values are analysed for reasonableness, so as to ascertain that the reported net asset value has been appropriately derived using proper fair value principles as part of a robust process. To approximate the fair value at the reporting date, the net asset value is adjusted, where appropriate, for factors such as, subsequent capital contributions and fund distributions, movements in exchange rate and subsequent changes in the fair value of the underlying investee companies, where these are known to NIBC. The fair value of equity investments is established by applying capitalisation multiples to maintainable earnings. Maintainable earnings are estimated based on the normalised last twelve months’ Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA). Capitalisation multiples are derived from the enterprise value and the normalised last twelve months EBITDA at the acquisition date. On each reporting date, the capitalisation multiple of each equity investment is compared against those derived from the publicly available enterprise value and earnings information of traded peers, where these can be identified. 138 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Peer capitalisation multiples are normalised for factors such as differences in regional and economic environment, time lags in earnings information and one-off gains and losses. The resulting enterprise value is adjusted for net debt, non-controlling interests, illiquidity and management incentive plans to arrive at the fair value of the equity. Debt investments level 2 For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2013, NIBC used market-observable prices (including broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-verifiable data. NIBC has determined the fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and continuity of valuations. Debt investments level 3 For the level 3 debt investments, NIBC uses valuation models that apply discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates both observable and unobservable data. Observable inputs include interest rates and collateral values; unobservable inputs include assumptions regarding credit spreads and market liquidity discounts. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Loans level 2 In an active market environment, these assets are marked-to-market by applying market bid quotes observed on the secondary market. The quotes received from other banks or brokers and applied in the marked-to-market process are calibrated to actual market trades whenever possible. In certain instances, where the market is inactive, a discounted cash flow model is used based on various assumptions including market interest rates, market credit spread levels and assumptions regarding market liquidity, where relevant. Additional pricing reference points have been obtained by collecting spreads using primary transactions that are comparable with the relevant loans. Residential mortgages (own book and securitised) level 2 NIBC determines the fair value of residential mortgages (both those NIBC holds on its own book and those NIBC has securitised) by using a valuation model developed by NIBC. To calculate the fair value, NIBC discounts expected cash flows (after expected prepayments) to present value using inter-bank zerocoupon rates, adjusted for a spread that principally takes into account the credit spread risk of the mortgages and uncertainty relating to prepayment estimates. The RMBS spread is determined by collecting RMBS spreads from publicly issued Dutch RMBStransactions. The discount spread is derived by adding related RMBS costs to the RMBS spread. Sensitivity analysis carried out on the prepayment rates used in the valuation model of the residential mortgages showed that the variability in these rates does not have a significant impact on the total value of the Residential Mortgage portfolio. Debt investments level 2 For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2013, NIBC applied market-observable prices (including broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-observable data. NIBC has determined fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and continuity of valuations. Equity investments (including investments in associates) level 3 For the valuation method, reference is made to the section on equity investments (unlisted) at available-for-sale. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 139 Derivatives financial assets and liabilities (held for trading and used for hedging) level 2 Derivative products valued using a valuation technique with market-observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, currency swaps, credit default swaps and foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include swap models using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange rates, credit spread levels and interest rate curves. Credit derivative valuation models also require input as to the estimated probability of default and recovery value. There were no transfers between the levels during 2013 and 2012. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (including trading) Own liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss level 2 This portfolio was designated at fair value through profit or loss and is reported on the face of the balance sheet under the following headings: nn Own debt securities in issue (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss); nn Debt securities in issue structured (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss); and nn Subordinated liabilities (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss). Debt securities in issue structured consist of notes issued with embedded derivatives that are tailored to specific investors’ needs. The return on these notes is dependent upon the level of certain underlying equity, interest rate, currency, credit, commodity or inflation-linked indices. The embedded derivative within each note issued is fully hedged on a back-to-back basis, such that effectively synthetic floating rate funding is created. Because of this economic hedge, the income statement is not sensitive to fluctuations in the price of these indices. In the case of debt securities in issue structured and subordinated liabilities, the fair value of the notes issued and the back-to-back hedging swaps is determined using valuation models developed by a third party employing Monte Carlo simulation, lattice valuations or closed formulas, depending on the type of embedded derivative. These models use market-observable inputs (e.g. interest rates, equity prices) for valuation of these structures. For each class of own financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the expected cash flows are discounted to present value using interbank zero-coupon rates. The resulting fair value is adjusted for movements in the credit spread applicable to NIBC issued funding. 140 Notes to the consolidated financial statements The following table shows a reconciliation of the opening and closing amount of level 3 financial assets and liabilities which are recorded at fair value: Total gains/ (losses) Total gains/ At recorded in (losses) At 31 1 January the income recorded in December in eur millions 2012 statement equity Purchases Sales Settlements 2012 AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Equity investments 66 33 (9) 2 (43) 49 Debt investments 8 1 (3) (2) 4 FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS (INCLUDING TRADING) Equity investments (including investments in associates) 258 2 22 (67) 215 332 36 (9) 24 (113) (2) 268 Total gains/ (losses) Total gains/ At recorded in (losses) At 31 1 January the income recorded December in eur millions 2013 statement in equity Purchases Sales Settlements 2013 AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Equity investments 49 8 1 1 (12) 47 Debt investments 4 (1) 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS (INCLUDING TRADING) Equity investments (including investments in associates) 215 (1) 62 (19) 257 268 7 1 63 (32) 307 Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 141 Total gains or losses on level 3 financial instruments for the year in the previous table are presented in the income statement and other comprehensive income as follows: For the period ended 31 December 2013 Revaluation of equity Gains less losses investments from financial included in assets recognised the other in the income comprehensive IN EUR MILLIONS statement income AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Equity investments (unlisted) 8 1 Debt investments FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS (INCLUDING TRADING) Equity investments (including investments in associates) (1) 7 1 The unrealised gains or (losses) included in the profit or loss of equity investments (unlisted) categorised on level 3 amounted to EUR 9 million.

The primary unobservable input in the calculated model price is the applicable credit spread. In 2013, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affect the fair value of the NIBC’s financial assets and liabilities. In 2013, there were no reclassifications of financial assets. 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Fair value information about financial instruments not measured at fair value The following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis.

NIBC hedges its interest rate risk from these assets. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These financial instruments include cash and balances with central banks, due from other banks, due to other banks, deposits from customers and other financial liabilities. These financial instruments are not included in the previous table. Non-financial assets valued at fair value NIBC’s land and buildings are valued at fair value. The carrying amount of NIBC’s land and buildings (level 3) as of 31 December 2013 was EUR 40 million. The land and buildings were last revalued as of 31 December 2011 based on an external appraisal. No amounts were recognised in the statment of comprehensive income or the income statement in respect of NIBC’s land and buildings in 2013.

The securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase are transferred to a third party and the bank receives cash, or other financial assets in exchange. The counterparty is allowed to sell or repledge those securities lent or sold under repurchase agreements in the absence of default by the bank, but has an obligation to return the securities at the maturity of the contract. These transactions are conducted under terms based on the applicable ISDA Collateral Guidelines. If the securities increase or decrease in value, the bank may in certain circumstances, require, or be required, to pay additional cash collateral. NIBC has determined that it retains substantially all the risks and rewards of these securities and therefore has not derecognised them. In addition, it recognises a financial liability for cash received as collateral. Similarly NIBC may sell or repledge any securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, but has an obligation to return the securities and the counterparty retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Consequently the securities are not recognised by the bank, which instead records a separate asset for the cash collateral given. NIBC transacted several repurchase transactions with third parties, in which notes amounting to a notional of EUR 384 million (with a fair value at 31 December 2013 of EUR 480 million) were transferred from NIBC to third parties at 31 December 2013 in exchange for deposits of EUR 384 million advanced to NIBC at 31 December 2013 for periods ranging from six months up to four years. NIBC transacted several reverse repurchase transactions with third parties, in which notes amounting to a notional of EUR 15 million (with a fair value at 31 December 2013 of EUR 15 million) were transferred to NIBC from third parties at 31 December 2013 in exchange for EUR 15 million in deposit at 31 December 2013 for a period of one year. NIBC conducts these transactions under terms agreed in Global Master Repurchase Agreements. Assets not derecognised in their entirety In prior years, NIBC transferred certain financial assets to securitisation vehicles it did not control. NIBC has determined that as a consequence of providing clean up calls (call option to purchase the loans if the principal outstanding of all notes in the securitisation vehicles is less than 10% of the principal amount) not substantially all risks and rewards were transferred, consequently NIBC continues to recognise these financial assets and related liabilities to the extent of its continuing involvement. For further details see the following table: For the period ended 31 December 2013 Carrying amount Carrying amount IN EUR MILLIONS asset related liability Loans at fair value through profit or loss 65 Debt securities in issue related to securitised mortgages (amortised costs) 65 For the period ended 31 December 2013 Carrying amount of IN EUR MILLIONS assets before transfer Loans at fair value through profit or loss 65 For further explanation reference is made to the Critical accounting estimates and judgements section Securitisations and Special Purpose Entities. 146 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 46 Commitments and contingent assets and liabilities At any time, NIBC has outstanding commitments to extend credit. Outstanding loan commitments have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement period of one to three months. Commitments extended to customers related to mortgages at fixed-interest rates or fixed spreads are hedged with interest rate swaps recorded at fair value. These commitments are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. NIBC provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers to third parties. These agreements have fixed limits and generally extend for a period of up to five years. Expirations are not concentrated in any period. The contractual amounts of commitments and contingent liabilities are set out in the following table by category. In the table, it is assumed that amounts are fully advanced. The amounts for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum accounting loss that would be recognised at the balance sheet date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted. IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 CONTRACT AMOUNT Committed facilities with respect to corporate loan financing (including investment management loans) 910 1,153 Committed facilities with respect to residential mortgages financing 359 6 Capital commitments with respect to equity investments 38 43 Guarantees granted 99 95 Irrevocable letters of credit 6 34 1,412 1,331 These commitments and contingent liabilities have off-balance sheet credit risk because only commitment/origination fees and accruals for probable losses are recognised in the balance sheet until the commitments are fulfilled or expire. Many of the contingent liabilities and commitments will expire without being advanced in whole or in part. Therefore, the amounts do not represent expected future cash flows. Details of concentrations of credit risk including concentrations of credit risk arising from commitments and contingent liabilities as well as NIBC’s policies for collateral for loans are set out in note 53. Legal proceedings There were a number of legal proceedings outstanding against NIBC at 31 December 2013. No provision has been made, as legal advice indicates that it is unlikely that any significant loss will arise. 47 Business combinations No new business combinations were acquired in the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012. At 31 December 2013, NIBC has the potential obligation to sell a minority stake (less than 10%) in Olympia Nederland Holding B.V. to a third party. No material gain or loss is expected on this disposal.

Furthermore, NIBC pledges assets as collateral for derivative transactions. Substantially all financial assets included in these transactions are residential mortgages, other loan portfolios, debt investments and cash collateral. The extent of NIBC’s continuing involvement in these financial assets varies by transaction. With respect to assets utilised as collateral, the total portfolio eligible for use to collateralise funding amounted to EUR 5.0 billion (2012: EUR 4.5 billion), including assets already utilised as collateral. 49 Assets under management NIBC provides collateral management services, whereby it holds and manages assets or invests funds received in various financial instruments on behalf of customers. NIBC receives fee income for providing these services. Assets under management are not recognised in the consolidated balance sheet. NIBC is not exposed to any credit risk relating to such placements, as it does not guarantee these investments. IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 Assets held and managed by NIBC on behalf of customers 1,995 1,082 1,995 1,082 Assets under management consist of the following activities: nn NIBC Leveraged Finance Markets (LFM) manages external investors’ funds invested in sub-investment grade secured and unsecured debt. LFM focuses predominantly on European leveraged loans, as well as infrastructure debt and high yield bonds. In 2013, LFM issued the fourth CLO under the ‘North Westerly’ programme; nn NIBC’s European Infrastructure Fund was established for institutional clients, and in addition acts directly for pension fund investors, assisting them with the acquisition and on-going management of infrastructure investments. Core sectors, reflecting the expertise and experience of the NIBC team, include PPP projects, waste management projects, energy storage and distribution assets, and renewable energy projects in the wind, solar and waste to energy sectors; and nn NIBC’s sustainability policy framework, including applicable sector policies, is also applicable to the investments made under these programmes.

The interest received and paid on this exposure was at arm’s length. In June 2009, NIBC made a commitment of USD 10 million to ‘Flowers Fund III’ an investment fund managed by an affiliate of J.C. Flowers & Co. At 31 December 2013, the remaining undrawn commitment in this facility was USD 5 million. Fees paid to NIBC related to these asset management activities were nil for both 2013 and 2012. Transactions related to associates As at 31 December 2013, NIBC had EUR 55 million of loans advanced to its associates (2012: EUR 56 million). In addition to net interest income on these loans, NIBC did not earn fees from these associates in 2013 and 2012. In June 2007, NIBC launched the NIBC European Infrastructure Fund I, (which was NIBC’s first third-party equity fund) with a final close in August 2008. Total commitments to the fund amount to EUR 347 million, of which EUR 247 million is committed by four third-party investors and EUR 100 million by NIBC. The fund invests in infrastructure projects mainly in Western Europe. NIBC reported a gain from its investment in the fund in 2013 of EUR 6 million (2012: gain of EUR 1 million) and earned fees of EUR 3 million (2012: EUR 3 million). In NIBC’s financial statements, this fund is classified as an associate at fair value through profit or loss. In September 2008, NIBC launched the NIBC European CMBS Opportunity Fund. Of the total committed fund size of EUR 64 million, EUR 49 million is committed by third-party investors and EUR 15 million by NIBC. The fund invests in structured commercial real estate in Western Europe. In December 2013 the fund was terminated after the last investments were sold. NIBC’s did not receive income from this fund in 2013 and 2012. In NIBC’s financial statements, this fund is classified as an associate at fair value through profit or loss. In 2013 and 2012, NIBC did not earn advisory fees for services to J.C. Flowers & Co.

The review took into account all relevant regulations and guidelines: the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Dutch Banking Code, the DNB Principles on Sound Remuneration Policies (DNB Principles), including additional DNB guidance on the implementation of the DNB Principles and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors Guidelines on Remuneration Policies and Practices (CEBS Guidelines). In response to social developments and further regulatory changes, the Supervisory Board decided to further amend the remuneration policy for the Statutory Board early 2012. This resulted in an even more sustainable and long-term remuneration policy. The amendment includes eliminating short-term variable compensation altogether and strengthening the existing long-term compensation element. In view of current legislation, the Supervisory Board is not able to grant any variable compensation for as long as NIBC has not repaid all outstanding state guaranteed funding. Regular annual remuneration In 2013, the average number of members of the Statutory Board appointed under the articles of association was 3.6 (2012: 5.0). For the total regular annual remuneration costs (including pension costs) for members and former members of the Statutory Board, appointed under the articles of association, reference is made to note 8 Personnel expenses and share-based payments. On 30 April 2013 Mr. van Dijkhuizen stepped down as Statutory Board member and his employment ended per the same date. On 1 October 2013 Mr. Dijkhuizen joined the Statutory Board. Base salary and short-term incentive compensation (cash bonus) As of 1 January 2013, the base salary for the Chairman remained at EUR 800,000 gross per annum, whilst the base salary for members remained at EUR 500,000 gross per annum. As of 1 January 2012, all shortterm variable compensation has been eliminated.

Other remuneration elements The other remuneration elements of the Statutory Board members consist of car and other expense allowances, mortgage subsidy, dividend compensation on conditionally granted share rewards and other emoluments. 152 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Table 2 IN EUR 2013 2012 THE BREAKDOWN OF THE AMOUNTS OF OTHER REMUNERATION ELEMENTS PER MEMBER AND FORMER MEMBER OF THE STATUTORY BOARD IS AS FOLLOWS: Mr. Jeroen Drost 142,161 151,234 Mr. Rob ten Heggeler 102,242 94,644 Mr. Herman Dijkhuizen 16,889 Ms. Petra van Hoeken 82,845 42,128 Mr. Kees van Dijkhuizen, former Chief Financial Officer 41,706 75,941 Mr. Jeroen van Hessen, former Member 18,994 91,733 Long-term incentive compensation (Conditional Restricted Depositary Receipts) As of 1 January 2012 the maximum long-term incentive is 70% of base salary for the CEO, 60% for members of the Managing Board responsible for commercial activities and 40% for the CFO and CRO. If any LTI is conditionally granted, this will be in the form of 66.67% CRDRs and 33.33% cash. The LTI is conditional upon the achievement of performance conditions, is forward-looking and is subject to a threeyear performance period and an additional three-year pro-rated deferral period. The Supervisory Board has agreed a set of six long-term performance conditions. Two are financial performance conditions and have a weight of 60% (average return on equity and average impairment level). Four are non-financial performance conditions and have a weight of 40% (employee engagement, client satisfaction for corporate as well as consumer clients and diversity). These are aligned with the overall corporate targets. The final LTI grant depends on the degree to which the agreed performance criteria have been met. In view of current legislation, the Supervisory Board is not able to grant any variable compensation until NIBC has repaid all outstanding Dutch state guaranteed funding. The three-year performance period of a total of 13,808 CRDRs under the LTI 2011 ended 1 January 2014. The Supervisory Board reviewed the agreed long-term financial and non-financial performance conditions. The financial performance conditions (60%) were not met. The non-financial performance conditions (40%) were almost met on stretch level. The Supervisory Board therefore awarded a vesting of 38% of the LTI 2011 CRDRs, which will fully vest at 1 April 2014, in line with the interim re-measurement done at year-end 2012. Consequently 62% of the LTI 2011 forfeited. The vested instruments have an additional retention period of two years. Furthermore the vested instruments need to be held until a liquidity event takes place to ensure alignment with the shareholders.

The non-financial performance conditions (40%) were met in full. The Supervisory Board therefore awarded a vesting of 40% of the LTI 2010 CRDRs, which have fully vested into CCDRs at 1 January 2013. Consequently 60% of the LTI 2010 forfeited. The vested instruments have an additional retention period of two years. Furthermore the vested instruments need to be held until a liquidity event takes place to ensure alignment with the shareholders. 156 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Conditional Restricted Depositary Receipts ESTIMATED NUMBER OF CONDITIONAL RESTRICTED DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS (LTI) 2013 2012 Mr. Jeroen Drost 3,339 7,147 Mr. Rob ten Heggeler 1,908 4,084 Mr. Herman Dijkhuizen Ms. Petra van Hoeken Mr. Kees van Dijkhuizen, former Chief Financial Officer 4,084 Mr. Jeroen van Hessen, former Member The three-year performance period of a total of 13,808 CRDRs under the LTI 2011 ended 1 January 2014.

Furthermore the vested instruments need to be held until a liquidity event takes place to ensure alignment with the shareholders. Conditional Restricted Depositary Receipts One-off co-investment As a result of personal investments by the Statutory Board members in 2009 and 2012 matching shares were granted to the Statutory Board members in 2009 and in 2012, in the form of CRDRs with an after-tax value equal to the value of the personal investment made. In addition to the matching shares, the Statutory Board members can earn performance shares (CRDRs), subject to a service condition (continuous employment) and the realisation of predetermined performance conditions. For the number of CRDRs reference is made to the following tables. NIBC has the discretion to offer new members of the Statutory Board the opportunity to participate in this coinvestment programme under the same conditions, except for the ability to earn performance shares, as this feature is presumed no longer to be in line with current DNB Principles. This offer was made to Mr. Herman Dijkhuizen when he joined the Statutory Board on 1 October 2013 and it was accepted by him in December 2013 at a price of EUR 8.33 per CDR being the fair value at that time. The CRDRs (matching shares) are subject to a four-year vesting with one quarter vesting each year, for the first time on 1 January 2015.

The number of performance shares that vest is based on a predetermined formula. The number of performance shares contained in this variable compensation is in principle uncapped, but the Supervisory Board has the discretion to adjust the ultimate number in the case of unfair or unintended effects. For reporting purposes, the number of performance shares for the combined Statutory Board is estimated at nil CRDRs, based on NIBC’s long-term forecast and taking into account price-to-book ratios observed in the market. Depending on the assumptions applied, this number can vary over time. The conditional performance shares will vest immediately upon a change of control of NIBC Holding.

In 2012 the Statutory Board, after consultation with the Supervisory Board, decided to apply this three-year extension. In line with internal policies, Mr van Hessen’s vested in the money options were exercised on a cashless basis and subsequently converted into CDRs in the first open period after his employment ended on 31 December 2012. 158 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 53 Credit risk This section includes all financial assets subject to credit risk. Non-credit obligations fall under other risk types, such as market risk, and equity is subject to investment risk. The following portfolios that contain credit risk have been identified: nn Corporate/Investment Loans; nn Residential Mortgages; nn Debt Investments; nn Cash Management; and nn Derivatives. The Debt Investments portfolio is further subdivided into debt from financial institutions and corporate entities and securitisations. 53-1 Credit risk exposure breakdown per portfolio IN EUR MILLIONS 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 CORPORATE/ INVESTMENT LOANS 7,681 8,923 Corporate loans 7,555 8,750 Investment loans 126 173 RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES 7,564 8,187 DEBT INVESTMENTS 1,549 1,346 Debt from financial institutions and corporate entities 711 601 Securitisations 838 745 CASH MANAGEMENT 1,795 2,188 DERIVATIVES1 2,800 3,917 TOTAL 21,389 24,561 1 Positive replacement values. Table 53-1 presents the maximum credit risk exposure per portfolio, without taking collateral or any other credit risk reduction into consideration. For all portfolios except derivatives, this is generally the total commitment of NIBC, which also includes off-balance sheet commitments such as guarantees and undrawn credit lines. Only the positive replacement values for derivatives are shown, without netting and without any potential future exposure add-on. The figures in table 53-1 are not directly comparable to the figures on the balance sheet. Corporate and investment loans include off-balance sheet exposures and exclude exposures from NIBC Bank to NIBC Holding. Residential mortgages are recognised on the balance sheet under residential mortgages own book and securitised residential mortgages. Debt investments (securitisations) differ from the figure on the balance sheet due to off-balance sheet exposures as disclosed in the Risk Management notes and due to partial offsetting of risk exposure with liabilities to the same counterparties. The main difference in the cash figures is due to collateral posting on credit risk differences for derivatives/repos. The exposure of a securitised loan (EUR 143 million) is included in the Corporate Loan portfolio. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 159 Corporate loans Corporate loan distribution The industry sectors shown in tables 53-2 and 53-3 are based on NACE classification and as such, do not strictly follow the internal NIBC sector organisation that is presented in the risk management chapter, although a large overlap exists. NACE is the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (in French: Nomenclature Statistique des Activités Ếconomiques dans la Communauté Européenne), an EU industry standard classification system specifying eleven industry sectors. The overview mapping NACE codes with NIBC reporting sectors on NIBC’s website contains a detailed breakdown of the NACE codes allocated to NIBC’s exposures. Tables 53-2 and 53-3 display a breakdown of the Corporate Loan portfolio among regions and industry sectors, at year-end 2013 and 2012. In line with our stategy, the Corporate Loan portfolio reduced by EUR 1,195 million in 2013 to EUR 7,555 million mainly because of the exposure reduction in the infrastructure, commercial real estate and shipping industry sectors. Compared to 2012, the relative weights of NIBC’s core growth markets the Netherlands and Germany remained stable, while the relative share of the United Kingdom increased slightly. The Corporate Loan portfolio outside Europe decreased to 14% of the total exposure at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012:17%). 53-2 Corporate loan exposure per industry sector and region, 31 December 2013 Wholesale/ TOTAL InfraCommercial Financial ManuRetail/ Agriculture (IN EUR IN % struc­ture Real Estate Shipping Oil & Gas Services facturing Services Leisure & Food TMT1 Other TOTAL Millions) The Netherlands 4 9 2 1 3 4 3 2 1 1 30 2,288 Germany 4 10 1 3 2 1 1 1 1 24 1,698 United Kingdom 16 1 1 18 1,449 Rest of Europe 2 5 4 1 1 1 14 1,106 Asia / Pacific 4 2 6 401 North America 3 1 4 336 Other 2 2 4 277 TOTAL 26 19 17 11 7 7 5 4 2 2 100 7,555 TOTAL (in EUR millions) 1,979 1,445 1,161 864 551 527 398 347 168 109 6 7,555 1 Telecommunication, Media and Technology. 53-3 Corporate loan exposure per industry sector and region, 31 December 2012 Wholesale/ TOTAL InfraCommercial Financial ManuRetail/ Agriculture (IN EUR IN % struc­ture Real Estate Shipping Oil & Gas Services facturing Services Leisure & Food TMT1 Other TOTAL Millions) The Netherlands 4 10 2 1 3 2 3 3 1 1 30 2,564 Germany 4 11 1 2 2 1 2 23 2,050 United Kingdom 15 2 1 18 1,576 Rest of Europe 2 4 3 1 1 1 12 1,087 Asia/Pacific 6 2 8 715 North America 3 2 5 404 Other 2 2 4 354 TOTAL 25 21 18 12 6 5 5 5 1 2 100 8,750 TOTAL (in EUR millions) 2,190 1,941 1,521 1,015 483 446 446 467 85 150 6 8,750 1 Telecommunication, Media and Technology. 160 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Basel II and credit approval process NIBC employs an internally-developed methodology under the Basel II Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) approach for quantifying the credit quality of its Corporate Loan portfolio. The Basel II AIRB approach for NIBC’s exposure classes was adopted by NIBC and approved by NIBC’s regulatory authority, the DNB, in 2008. In line with Basel II regulations, the methodology consists of three elements: nn CCR, reflecting the PD of the borrower. The default definition is in line with the Basel II definition1; nn LGD, defined as an anticipated loss element that expresses the potential loss in the event of default, which takes into account the presence and the value of collateral; and nn EAD, which is the amount that is expected to be outstanding at the moment a counterparty defaults. The PDs, LGDs and EADs that are calculated through NIBC’s internal models are used for the calculation of expected loss (EL) and Basel II/Pillar 1 regulatory capital (RC). Economic capital (EC), risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC), limit setting and stress testing are additional areas which make use of these parameters, although the values and methodologies for both EC and stress testing differ from those employed in Pillar 1. PDs, LGDs and EADs are also used in the Basel II solvency report to the regulator. Annual backtests of the internal rating framework are carried out to assess the quality and the performance of the models. The internal CCRs and LGDs are also benchmarked periodically with the scales of external rating agencies. NIBC enforces strict separation of responsibilities with respect to its internal rating methodologies and rating process, model development, model validation and internal audit. The roles and responsibilities of each department involved are explicitly set out in internal policies and manuals, also in conformity with the stipulations of Basel II on model governance. All approvals of individual credit proposals are granted after the Credit Risk Management department (CRM) or the Financial Markets Credit Risk department (FMCR) have made a credit risk assessment and have analysed proposals by taking into consideration, among others, aggregate limits set per country, per industry segment, and per individual counterparty. The total one obligor exposure and related exposure are also taken into account. Individual credit and transaction proposals are then approved in the Transaction Committee (TC). Proposals, credit reviews and amendments of smaller scale can be approved by CRM, for corporate counterparties, or FMCR, for non-corporate counterparties. All counterparties and, subsequently, all facilities, are reviewed at least once a year. 1 According to the Basel II definition, a default is determined at the borrower level. A default is indicated by using a 9 or 10 rating in NIBC’s internal rating scale. A default is considered to have occurred with respect to a particular obligor when either or both of the two following events have taken place: i) The bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the banking group in full, without recourse by the bank to actions such as realising security (if held); ii) The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the banking group. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 161 Credit ratings NIBC uses an internal through-the-cycle CCR rating scale, which consists of 10 grades (1-10) and a total of 22 notches. The CCRs 9 and 10 are assigned to counterparties that have already defaulted and therefore carry a PD of 100%. The weighted average CCR of the non-defaulted clients was 6 with an average PD of 2.9% at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: 2.4%). The credit quality in terms of CCRs remained concentrated in the sub-investment grade categories 5 and 6 (BB and B categories in external rating agencies’ scales). Graph 53-4 shows the distribution of the drawn and undrawn corporate loan exposure per CCR. The numbers on the horizontal axis refer to NIBC’s internal rating scale, whereas the letters in parentheses refer to the equivalent rating scale of Standard & Poor’s. NR stands for not rateable, which was a negligible portion of the corporate loans (0.2% at 31 December 2013; 0.2% at 31 December 2012). NR is assigned to entities, for which NIBC’s corporate rating tools were not suitable at the time of rating. 53-4 Drawn and undrawn corporate loan exposure per CCR rating IN % 2013 Drawn 2013 Undrawn 2012 Drawn 2012 Undrawn 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 1-3 4 5 6 7 8 9-10 NR (AAA/AA/A) (BBB) (BB) (B) (CCC) (CC/C) (D) Collateral and LGD NIBC’s internal LGD scale consists of 7 grades (A-F) and 10 notches, each of which represents a different degree of recovery prospects and loss expectations. LGD ratings are facility-specific. The weighted average LGD remained stable at B-2 with an average LGD of 15.3% at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: 16.0%). The weighted average is calculated for non-defaulted loans. All facilities within NIBC have some form of collateralisation, resulting in LGDs concentrated in those LGD categories which correspond to high recoveries in the range of 80% and 90%. Graph 53-5 shows the distribution of drawn and undrawn corporate loan exposures per LGD. The letters on the horizontal axis refer to NIBC’s LGD grades and notches, whereas the numbers in parentheses refer to the loss percentage assigned to each LGD rating. NR was negligible (1.2% of corporate loans at 31 December 2013; 0.3% at 31 December 2012). Note that the corporate loan exposure of graph 53-5 refers to non-defaulted exposure as the LGD is a measure of anticipated loss for facilities of a non-defaulted counterparty. Once a counterparty enters default, the impairment amount becomes a more meaningful measure of the loss. Tables 53-9 and 53-10 provide more information on impairment amounts. 162 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 53-5 Drawn and undrawn non-defaulted corporate loan exposure per LGD rating IN % 2013 Drawn 2013 Undrawn 2012 Drawn 2012 Undrawn 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 A-1+ A-2 B-1 B-2 B-3 C-1 C-2 D E F NR (2.5%) (7.5%) (12.5%) (18%) (25%) (33%) (42.5%) (55%) (70%) (90%) The most significant types of collateral securing the loan and derivative portfolios are tangible assets, such as real estate, vessels, rigs and equipment. Exposures in the shipping and oil & gas sectors are primarily secured by moveable assets such as vessels and drilling vessels. The commercial real estate portfolio is primarily collateralised by mortgages on financed properties. Collateral value is estimated using third-party appraisers, whenever possible, or valuation techniques based on common market practice. For example, loan-to-value ratios are regularly tested and vessels are appraised semi-annually by external parties. Other commercial exposures are, to a large extent, collateralised by assets such as inventory, debtors, (lease) receivables and third-party credit protection (e.g. guarantees). Arrears The total arrears in the Corporate Loan portfolio decreased substantially in 2013 to 0.7% of total exposure at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: 1.9%). An overview of the amounts in arrear per arrear bucket is provided in tables 53-6 and 53-7. The exposure amounts refer to drawn and undrawn amounts of those facilities with an arrear, whereas the outstanding amounts refer to the drawn amounts only. The amounts in arrear are the actual amounts overdue at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012. The column labelled ‘Impairment Amount’ includes on-balance sheet impairment amounts only (31 December 2013: EUR 102 million; 31 December 2012: EUR 128 million). The inclusion of Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) impairment amounts on the line with no payment in arrear brings the total impairment amount for 31 December 2013 to EUR 107 million (31 December 2012: EUR 134 million). Tables 53-9 and 53-10 provide more information on impairment amounts.

If the total arrear on facility level is lower than EUR 25,000 per facility, the age of the payment in arrear is below 30 days and the counterparty has not defaulted, then the arrear is considered insignificant. If arrears fall within the threshold, the exposure is placed on the ‘no payment in arrear’ line on tables 53-6 and 53-7. The application of this threshold does not influence the total arrears, which amounted to EUR 53 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: EUR 168 million). At 31 December 2013, the total arrears considered insignificant were EUR 226 (31 December 2012: EUR 17,849). Graph 53-8 displays the rating distribution of the exposure amounts (expressed as the sum of drawn and undrawn amounts) of all loans with an amount in arrear. The total exposure amount at 31 December 2013 was EUR 102 million (31 December 2012: EUR 307 million) and the total drawn amount at 31 December 2013 was EUR 94 million (31 December 2012: EUR 296 million). This reduction was driven mainly by restructurings in the commercial real estate and shipping industry sectors. 164 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 53-8 Distribution of drawn and undrawn amounts with an arrear per rating category IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 Drawn 2013 Undrawn 2012 Drawn 2012 Undrawn 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 4 (BBB) 5 (BB) 6 (B) 7 (CCC) 8 (CC/C) 9/10 (D) Forbearance Corporate Loans As a response to the public statement of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) related to forbearance practices issued on 20 December 2012, NIBC is currently in the process of developing a forbearance policy for the Corporate Loan portfolio. The forbearance policy will be defined, formalised and implemented in the standard working routines and processes around credit review and impairment in 2014. In practice, NIBC is already providing forbearance solutions under certain conditions to corporate borrowers experiencing financial difficulties and which consequently are unable to meet the original terms and conditions of the contract. All loan and other facilities are subject to NIBC’s impairment policy and are assessed when relevant impairment triggers have been met. ‘Significant financial difficulty of the borrower’ is one of the impairment triggers within NIBC. Forbearance is objective evidence of impairment and therefore an impairment test is already considered for each forborne loan facility. Details of NIBC’s impairment policy can be found in the Accounting policies section. Impairment amounts The Corporate Loan portfolio is reviewed by credit officers and CRM, who monitor the quality of counterparties and the related collateral. Formal assessment of the entire portfolio takes place on a quarterly basis. All existing impairments are reviewed as well. NIBC calculates an impairment amount by taking various factors into account, particularly the available collateral securing the loan and the corporate derivative exposure, if present. The loss amount is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. If collateral is present, then the present value of the future cash flows reflects the foreclosure of collateral. More information on the method impairments are calculated is included in the Accounting Policies section. NIBC determines a default at counterparty level, whereas an impairment amount is taken at facility level. When a default occurs, the entire exposure and outstanding amount of the borrower are classified as defaulted. If, however, an impairment amount is taken on a facility, only the exposure amount of that particular facility is classified as impaired. In 2013, the total write-offs increased (EUR 90 million) compared to 2012 (EUR 28 million), mainly in the wholesale, retail & leisure, commercial real estate, services and TMT industry sectors. The stock of impairments decreased and amounted to EUR 107 million at year-end 2013 (year-end 2012: EUR 134 million). In 2013, a new impairment was taken on a borrower in the wholesale, retail & leisure industry sector which had to be written-off in the same year.

Graph 53-11 displays the distribution of exposure amounts without impairments or arrears, at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012. Of this exposure 89% is rated in CCR categories 4, 5 and 6 (BBB, BB and B categories in external rating agencies’ scales). NR represents a negligible part of the portfolio (31 December 2013: 0.3% of all loans without impairments or amounts in arrear; 31 December 2012: 0.2%). 166 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 53-11 Distribution of exposure amount without impairments or arrears per rating category IN % 2013 2012 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 1(AAA) 2 (AA) 3 (A) 4 (BBB) 5 (BB) 6 (B) 7 (CCC) 8 (CC/C) 9/10 (D) NR Country risk Country risk is the likelihood that a country will not service its external debt obligations and reflects the risk that a country will not honour its external liabilities due to political, social, economic or financial turmoil. Country risk can potentially be an important cause of increased counterparty default risk since a large number of individual debtors could default at the same time. NIBC did not experience any counterparty defaults from this risk in 2013. NIBC has no sovereign debt exposure. Investment loans Investment loans are originated and monitored separately from the Corporate Loan portfolio. Investment loans are typically unsecured subordinated loans that contain equity characteristics such as attached warrants or conversion features. As such, investment loans typically carry a higher risk profile than corporate loans. Examples of these loans include mezzanine loans, convertible loans and shareholder loans. The investment loan can be divided into indirect investments and direct investments. Indirect investments are investments made through funds set up and managed by NIBC (NIBC Funds) that are controlled by NIBC and thus consolidated into the financial statements of NIBC. Direct investments are all other investments. Direct investments are approved by the Investment Committee (IC) of NIBC. Indirect investments are approved by the investment committees of the NIBC Funds, subject to the investment guidelines stipulated in the fund agreements between the manager of the NIBC Fund and the investors. Investment officers monitor the quality of counterparties in the portfolio on a regular basis. On a quarterly basis, the entire Investment Loan portfolio is assessed for impairment. All existing impairments are reviewed. Impairments of indirect investments are determined by the manager of the NIBC Fund. All impairments are reviewed and approved by the IC. The total size of the investment loans at 31 December 2013 was EUR 126 million (31 December 2012: EUR 173 million), of which 98% was drawn (31 December 2012: 95%). In line with the characteristics of the asset class, investment loans typically carry riskier internal CCRs and often a higher LGD than corporate loans. At 31 December 2013, the weighted average counterparty credit rating of non-defaulted investment loans remained stable at an internal rating 6 (31 December 2012: 6) in NIBC’s internal rating scale (equivalent to B in external rating agencies’ scales).

Servicing and administration of the mortgage portfolio is outsourced to third-party servicers, but special servicing is performed in-house. At 31 December 2013, 28% of the Residential Mortgage portfolio (31 December 2012: 27%) had a Dutch government guarantee (NHG guarantee) in accordance with the general terms and conditions set by the Stichting Waarborgfonds Eigen Woningen (WEW, Social Housing Guarantee Fund). A large part of the Dutch Residential Mortgage portfolio has been securitised. In most cases, NIBC has retained the junior notes and other positions related to these securitisation programmes. As a result the securitisation programmes are consolidated on NIBC’s balance sheet. The total amount of the retained positions at 31 December 2013 was EUR 348 million (31 December 2012: EUR 461 million). Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 169 Risk governance Dutch Residential Mortgages In order to control the credit risk in the origination of residential mortgages, an acceptance policy framework was formulated to screen residential mortgage applications. Acceptance depends on the following underwriting criteria: nn Conformity with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Credits of the Dutch Bankers Association; nn A check of an applicant’s credit history with the Dutch National Credit Register (Bureau Krediet Registratie or BKR), a central credit agency used by financial institutions in the Netherlands, which records five years of financial commitments and negative credit events; nn Mortgage loans are secured by first-ranking mortgage rights; nn Properties are occupied by the owner; nn Other criteria, such as type of property, maximum Loan-To-Market Value (LTMV) and maximum Loan-to-Income (LTI); and nn Underwriting criteria for mortgages with an NHG guarantee are set in accordance with the general terms and conditions set by the WEW. The WEW finances itself by a one-off up-front charge to the borrower as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan. The NHG guarantee covers losses on the outstanding principal, accrued unpaid interest, and disposal costs, caused by foreclosure. In 2013, the Dutch government introduced the following mortgage reforms: nn Tax deductibility is restricted to fully amortising mortgages for new mortgage contracts; nn Existing mortgage contracts still benefit from tax deductibility, however deductibility will be reduced from 52% to 38% by 0.5% per annum for all mortgages; and nn Possibility to take out a ‘duo-mortgage’; half of the down-payment on the first loan can be financed by a second loan (interest is not tax deductible) with a maximum of 35 years. Management of loans in arrear Dutch Residential Mortgages In order to control the credit risk in the Dutch Residential Mortgage portfolio, NIBC has established procedures to manage all loan amounts in arrear. All amounts in arrear are managed in-house. This ensures a dedicated team focused on preventing and minimising credit losses. The Special Servicing Mortgages team is responsible for arrears, client retention, foreclosures, collecting remaining debts and visiting clients and properties that serve as collateral. The special servicing at NIBC is centered on intensive contact with its mortgage clients and tailor-made solutions. When amounts in arrear occur, the borrower receives a letter after the first day of arrears. Within two weeks, the client is contacted by phone. Depending on the outcome of these contacts, a customerspecific approach is formulated on a case-by-case basis. Customer visits are made if arrears reach two months. In case of defaults, the Special Servicing team has to submit the file to the Arrears Management Committee for approval of the strategy to be followed. The Arrears Management Committee includes members from Risk Management, Operations, Portfolio Management and the Special Servicing team. NIBC bids for own foreclosed properties at auctions to ensure the proceeds are at arm’s length and if need be acquires these properties. NIBC is also introducing a programme under which customers who may face potential financial difficulties are approached pro-actively with the intention of identifying and resolving difficulties before actual arrears arise. Table 53-18 shows the arrears overview of the total Dutch Residential Mortgage portfolio at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012. Overall, the amount of loans in arrears remains relatively stable, except for loans in arrear at year-end 2013 in the ‘over 90 days bucket’ , which have shown an increase compared to year-end 2012. 170 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 53-18 Arrears overview, Dutch Residential Mortgage portfolio IN % 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 No payment in arrear 95.9 95.8 0-30 days 1.9 2.2 31-60 days 0.6 0.8 61-90 days 0.3 0.3 Over 90 days 1.3 0.9 TOTAL 100 100 TOTAL (IN EUR MILLION) 7,331 7,836 Forbearance Dutch Residential Mortgages As a response to the public statement of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) related to forbearance practices issued on 20 December 2012, NIBC has developed a forbearance policy for mortgage clients experiencing financial difficulties and who consequently are unable to meet the original terms and conditions of the contract. The forbearance policy is defined, formalised and implemented in the standard working routines and processes. Further developments are expected in 2014. Risk measurement Dutch Residential Mortgages In 2008, NIBC’s rating methodology for residential mortgages received approval from the DNB to use the AIRB approach for calculating solvency requirements and reporting to the DNB. The calculation of PD, LGD and EAD is performed by an internally-developed Basel II AIRB model. This AIRB model is periodically assessed by the DNB to ensure that their requirements are met. The PD estimates are dependent on a variety of factors, of which the key factors are debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios. Minor factors that play a role in the PD estimates are several other mortgage loan characteristics, borrower characteristics and payment performance information. The PD scale is based on a continuous scale ranging from 0-100%. The LGD estimates are based on a downturn scenario comparable to the downturn in the Dutch mortgage market in the 1980s. In this case, the indexed collateral value is stressed in order to simulate the proceeds of a sale or foreclosure of the collateral. The stress is dependent on the location and the absolute value of the collateral. Together with cost and time-to-foreclosure assumptions, an LGD is derived. The LGD estimate also takes into account whether a mortgage loan has an NHG guarantee, for which the LGD estimate will be lower in comparison to a mortgage loan without the NHG guarantee. The LGD estimate is also based on a continuous scale. The validation of these estimates is performed on historical data and is carried out annually. For the PD and LGD, the estimates are backtested against realised defaults and realised losses. In this way it is ensured that the model functions correctly in a changing economic environment. Table 53-19 shows the PD distribution of the Dutch Residential Mortgage portfolio at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012. A PD of 100% means that a borrower is more than 90 days in arrear. Mortgages without amounts in arrear all carry PDs below 2%.

For the portfolio not covered by the NHG programme, the underlying property is the primary collateral for any mortgage loan granted, though savings and investment deposits may also serve as additional collateral. An indicator for potential losses, taking into account indexation of house prices and seasoning, is achieved by calculating the Loan-to-Indexed-Market-Value (LTIMV). The indexation is made by using the CBS/ Kadaster index, which is based on market observables. The Kadaster (national property register) is a public government register of real estate and their vested rights (e.g. ownership and mortgages). This register contains transaction data as well as CBS (Statistics Netherlands) data, which are used to construct a pricing index. Graphs 53-20 and 53-21 show a breakdown of the LTIMV for the total Dutch Residential Mortgage portfolio at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012. The average seasoning of the total portfolio is 9.4 years. LTIMV for all categories remained relatively stable between the two years. 20% of the total portfolio has an LTIMV above 100%. For the remainder of the portfolio, the indexed collateral value is less than or equal to the nominal loan balance outstanding or is a NHG mortgage. 53-20/21 LTIMV of Dutch Residential Mortgage portfolio IN % NHG-guaranteed 13 11 >=0% and <40% 28 7 27 >=40% and <50% 7 >=50% and <60% 9 >=60% and <70% 10 >=70% and <80% 6 >=80% and <90% 6 9 8 >=90% and <100% 4 5 >=100% and <110% 6 9 7 9 9 10 >=110% 31 December 2013 (EUR 7,331 million) 31 December 2012 (EUR 7,836 million) 172 Notes to the consolidated financial statements German Residential Mortgage portfolio The German Residential Mortgage portfolio amounted to EUR 233 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: EUR 351 million). The majority of this portfolio was acquired from third parties via two portfolio purchases. The purchased portfolios contain highly seasoned loans with low LTMV. The German Residential Mortgage portfolio was designated in 2011 as a legacy portfolio; therefore no new originations have taken place since 2011. In order to manage the credit risk of the German Residential Mortgage portfolio, NIBC has standardised procedures to manage all loan amounts in arrear. The arrear process starts directly by means of countered direct debits, i.e. when a direct withdrawal from the borrower’s account fails. The Arrears Management team contacts the customer to get insight into the reason for being in arrear. They claim the outstanding amount in letters sent every two weeks. In case of private insolvency or payment in arrear beyond 90 days, responsibility is taken over by a special servicer (a legal firm specialised in handling arrears and foreclosures). Table 53-22 displays an overview of the payments in arrear at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 for the German Residential Mortgage portfolio. It is market practice in Germany to start the foreclosure procedure after being more than six months in arrear (180 days) and the foreclosure procedure takes, on average, around two years. Special Servicing Cancelled Loans are loans for which the contract has been legally terminated by the lender and are being handled by the special servicer. At 31 December 2013, only 56 loans (3% of the total exposure) had been transferred to special servicing and cancelled, from a total portfolio of approximately 2,600 mortgages. 53-22 Arrears overview, German Residential Mortgage portfolio IN % 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 No payment in arrear 91.6 93.1 0-30 days 2.6 1.5 31-60 days 1.3 0.8 61-90 days 0.5 0.2 Over 90 days 1.0 0.9 Special Servicing Cancelled Loans 3.0 3.5 TOTAL 100 100 TOTAL (IN EUR MILLION) 233 351 As is the case in the Netherlands, the underlying property is the primary collateral for the granted mortgage loan. The majority of mortgage loans in Germany contain an annuity debt profile, leading to a lower outstanding balance during the lifetime of the loan. Debt investments NIBC defines credit risk in debt investments as issuer risk, which is the credit risk of losing the principal amount on products such as bonds. Issuer risk is calculated based on the book value. This portfolio does not contain any sovereign risk exposures. Risk monitoring and measurement Risk is controlled by setting single issuer limits and, in some cases, programme limits. All single issuer limits are approved by the TC or by delegated authority to the FMCR department. Apart from single issuer limits, risk is also monitored by assessing credit spread risk. Both sensitivity analysis (basis point values, BPVs) and Value at Risk (VaR) numbers are used. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 173 Note 54 on Market Risk contain more information on these variables. In the remainder of this section, the exposure has been divided into the following two sub-portfolios: nn Debt from financial institutions and corporate entities; and nn Securitisations. Debt from financial institutions and corporate entities NIBC invests in debt (bonds) issued by financial institutions and corporate entities. The size of this subportfolio increased in the course of 2013 by 18% to EUR 711 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: EUR 601 million). The credit profile of this portfolio improved in 2013 through increased investments in AAA covered bonds. Of the total exposure, 41% (31 December 2012: 40%) were covered bonds. The remaining 59% (31 December 2012: 60%) was senior unsecured debt. The amount of EUR 711 million at 31 December 2013 represents the maximum credit risk exposure, without taking into account the presence of any collateral that could be repossessed in case of default. The portfolio did not contain any credit default swap (CDS) exposures. 53-23 Debt of financial institutions and corporate entities, 31 December 2013 IN EUR MILLIONS AAA AA A BBB BB <= B NR Total Financial institutions 207 93 322 51 6 679 Corporate entities 21 11 32 TOTAL 207 93 322 72 17 711 53-24 Debt of financial institutions and corporate entities, 31 December 2012 IN EUR MILLIONS AAA AA A BBB BB <= B NR Total Financial institutions 150 38 355 35 6 584 Corporate entities 17 17 TOTAL 150 38 355 52 7 601 At both 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, the portfolio of debt from financial institutions and corporate entities had no impairments and contained no arrears. Securitisations NIBC has been an active participant on the securitisation market in the past decade, both as an originator and investor in securitisations. Tables 53-25 and 53-26 present an overview of NIBC’s total securitisation exposure resulting from its activities as investor in securitisations. The exposure relating to NIBC’s activities as an originator can be split into exposures related to consolidated and non-consolidated securitisations. If a securitisation programme is consolidated on NIBC’s balance sheet, the exposure to the underlying collateral is excluded from the securitisation exposure and included in the total exposures presented in note 53 on credit risk in the corporate loans or residential mortgages sections. NIBC’s total exposure as an originator to consolidated securitisations was EUR 400 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: EUR 604 million). NIBC distinguishes two Securitisation sub-portfolios: the portfolio of Western European Securitisations and the Liquidity Investments portfolio. NIBC’s total securitisation exposure (investor and non-consolidated originator) increased to EUR 838 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: EUR 745 million), mainly due to increased investments 174 Notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Liquidity Investments portfolio. Investments in the Liquidity Investments portfolio and divestments in the Western European Securitisations improved the credit quality of this portfolio. The portfolio of investments in Western European securitisations contains NIBC’s investor securitisations in Western Europe as well as all investments in NIBC’s own non-consolidated securitisations. All investments in NIBC’s own securitisations are subject to approval from both FMCR and Finance. The total amount of the portfolio of investments in Western Europe decreased to EUR 330 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: EUR 403 million). The Liquidity Investments portfolio was set up to invest part of NIBC’s excess liquidity in the securitisation market. Investments are limited to AAA rated RMBS transactions backed by Dutch collateral or European ABS and are eligible to be pledged as collateral with the European Central Bank (ECB). Apart from the strict mandate, each investment is pre-approved by FMCR. Exposure in this portfolio increased to EUR 508 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: EUR 342 million). 53-25 Exposure to securitised products, 31 December 2013 BOOK VALUE, IN EUR MILLIONS AAA AA A BBB BB <BB Total EU ABS 1 2 3 EU CDO 3 20 42 13 11 32 121 EU CMBS 10 17 14 6 11 22 80 EU RMBS 11 19 53 29 1 13 126 TOTAL WESTERN EUROPEAN SECURITISATIONS 24 57 109 48 23 69 330 NL RMBS AAA Liquidity portfolio 374 374 EUABS AAA Liquidity portfolio 134 134 TOTAL SECURITISATION EXPOSURE 532 57 109 48 23 69 838 53-26 Exposure to securitised products, 31 December 2012 BOOK VALUE, IN EUR MILLIONS AAA AA A BBB BB <BB Total EU ABS 1 3 4 EU CDO 10 33 41 19 12 23 138 EU CMBS 14 26 19 24 14 17 114 EU RMBS 13 20 54 37 10 13 147 TOTAL WESTERN EUROPEAN SECURITISATIONS 37 80 114 80 36 56 403 NL RMBS AAA Liquidity portfolio 342 342 TOTAL SECURITISATION EXPOSURE 379 80 114 80 36 56 745 Geographic distribution of securitisations Graph 53-27 presents the distribution of the Securitisations portfolio by geographic region at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012. NIBC allocates exposure to a region based on the geographic location in which the cash flows are generated. The geographic distribution illustrates that the majority of these assets are located in Western Europe, mainly in the Netherlands (50%) and the United Kingdom (14%). The graph further shows that NIBC’s exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal is limited and had decreased to EUR 39 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: EUR 45 million). Approximately 68% of this exposure is investment grade exposure. NIBC had no exposure in Greece at 31 December 2013 or 2012.

In 2013, NIBC’s risk management framework for cash management continued its conservative approach, taking into account the vulnerable financial markets. Risk monitoring and measurement NIBC places its excess cash with the DNB/Dutch State Treasury Agency and with a selected number of investment-grade financial institutions. A monitoring process is in place within the FMCR department for the approved financial institutions. Cash management exposures can be collateralised through reverse repo transactions or unsecured through interbank deposits and current accounts. 176 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Correspondent banking and third-party account providers Apart from the exposure in cash management, NIBC holds foreign currency accounts at correspondent banks and also utilises third-party account providers for internal securitisations. Exposures At 31 December 2013, NIBC’s total cash amounted EUR 1,795 million (31 December 2012: EUR 2,188 million). The decrease in cash was mainly a result of the redemptions and buy-backs of government-guaranteed funding. EUR 1,150 million of the cash was held at DNB, EUR 523 million at financial institutions and the remaining EUR 122 million at corporate entities (securitisation-related liquidity facilities). 53-30 Cash, 31 December 2013 IN EUR MILLIONS AAA AA A ≥ BBB Total Cash and balances with central banks 1,150 1,150 Financial institutions 396 127 523 Corporate entities 4 39 79 122 TOTAL 1,154 435 206 1,795 53-31 Cash, 31 December 2012 IN EUR MILLIONS AAA AA A ≥ BBB Total Cash and balances with central banks 1,604 1,604 Financial institutions 2 52 486 3 543 Corporate entities 31 10 41 TOTAL 1,637 52 496 3 2,188 At year-end 2013, EUR 1,129 million cash collateral has been excluded from the cash management exposure (year-end 2012: EUR 1,474 million) as this amount is restricted cash that relates to derivatives with a negative fair value and can be netted with these negative exposures. At both 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, this portfolio carried no impairments and no arrears. Credit risk in derivatives Credit risk in derivatives is the risk of having to replace the counterparty in derivative contracts. NIBC’s credit risk in derivatives can be split into exposures to financial institutions and corporate entities. NIBC’s policy is to minimise this risk. NIBC only enters into OTC contracts with financial institutions that are investment grade or with corporate entities where the exposure is secured by some form of collateral. Risk monitoring and measurement Credit risk in derivatives is based on the marked-to-market value and Potential Future Exposure (PFE) of the derivative. The PFE reflects a potential future change in marked-to-market value during the remaining lifetime of the derivative contract. For financial institutions, separate limits for credit risk are in place, based on the external rating. For corporate clients, NIBC enters into a derivative transaction as part of its overall relationship with the client. The credit approval process for these derivatives is closely linked with the credit approval process of the loan. Limit-setting proposals for both financial institutions and corporate counterparties are reviewed in the TC. For financial institutions, collateral postings under a CSA are taken into account. In 2013, NIBC started to centrally clear derivatives. EUR 433 million of NIBC’s derivative portfolio excluding netting, collateral and PFE has been centrally cleared. For corporate counterparties, both the loan and derivative are treated as a single package whereby the derivative often benefits from the security/collateral supporting the loan exposure. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 177 Exposures Tables 53-32 and 53-33 display NIBC’s exposures from credit risk in derivatives allocated across the rating class of the underlying counterparty. Exposure is the sum of the positive marked-to-market value of derivative contracts, excluding the effect of netting and collateral exchange. Due to amoritisations and limit origination, the total derivative exposure excluding netting and collateral decreased in 2013 to EUR 2,800 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: EUR 3,917 million). 53-32 Derivative exposure excluding netting and collateral, 31 December 2013 IN EUR MILLIONS AAA AA A BBB BB B CCC CC D NR Total Financial institutions 48 2,145 2 2,195 Corporate entities 30 1 4 226 57 176 82 19 10 605 TOTAL 30 49 2,149 228 57 176 82 19 10 2,800 53-33 Derivative exposure excluding netting and collateral, 31 December 2012 IN EUR MILLIONS AAA AA A BBB BB B CCC CC D NR Total Financial institutions 69 2,681 214 2,964 Corporate entities 40 329 272 253 15 40 4 953 TOTAL 40 69 2,681 543 272 253 15 40 4 3,917 Collateral To the extent possible, NIBC attempts to limit credit risk arising from derivatives. NIBC enters into bilateral collateral agreements with financial institutions to mitigate credit risk in OTC derivatives by means of CSAs. Positive marked-to-market values can be netted with negative marked-to-market values and the remaining exposure is mitigated through bilateral collateral settlements. Accepted collateral is mainly cash collateral, which is usually exchanged on a daily basis. The primary counterparties in these CSAs are large international banks with ratings of A or higher. NIBC generally carries out daily cash collateral exchanges to account for changes in the market value of the contracts included in the CSA. Terms and conditions of these CSAs are in line with general International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) credit support documents. Collateral from CSAs significantly decreases the credit exposure on derivatives, as presented in table 53-34 at 31 December 2013 and in table 53-35 at December 2012. 53-34 Derivative exposure including netting and collateral, 31 December 2013 IN EUR MILLIONS AA A BBB BB B CCC CC D NR Total Financial institutions 242 242 Corporate entities 30 4 223 56 173 82 19 10 597 TOTAL 30 246 223 56 173 82 19 10 839 53-35 Derivative exposure including netting and collateral, 31 December 2012 IN EUR MILLIONS AA A BBB BB B CCC CC D NR Total Financial institutions 1 63 64 Corporate entities 323 272 252 15 40 4 905 TOTAL 1 63 323 272 252 15 40 4 970 178 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Valuation of corporate derivatives (credit and debt value adjustments) CVA and DVA are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the risk of default of the counterparty as well as the own default risk of NIBC. The adjustments are applied to all OTC derivative contracts, except for those that benefit from a strong collateral agreement where cash collateral is regularly exchanged, mitigating the credit risk. In practice, this means that CVA and DVA are only applied to OTC derivative contracts that generate credit risk on corporate (i.e. non-financial) counterparties. Arrears NIBC applies a threshold for determining whether a derivative carries a non-material arrear. The criteria for this threshold are the same as for the portfolio of corporate loans. If amounts in arrear fall below the threshold, they are considered insignificant and are therefore excluded. The application of the threshold does not influence the total arrears for 2013 and 2012. For both years, the total arrears that are considered insignificant are below EUR 100 thousand. Table 53-36 displays an overview of the arrears for corporate derivatives at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 as well as the exposures (marked-to-market values) these arrears refer to. There were no amounts in arrear for derivatives with financial institutions. As shown in Table 53-36, at 31 December 2013, a marked-to-market exposure of EUR 31 million carried an arrear of EUR 5 million (31 December 2012: exposure of EUR 22 million with an arrear of EUR 9 million). 53-36 Arrears overview, corporate derivative exposure 2013 2012 IN EUR MILLIONS Exposure (MtM)1 Amount in arrear Exposure (MtM)1 Amount in arrear AGE OF PAYMENT IN ARREAR 15 days 23 2 11 1 6 30 days 31 60 days 61 90 days SUBTOTAL LESS THAN 90 DAYS 23 2 11 1 Over 90 days 8 3 11 8 No payment in arrear 574 931 TOTAL 605 5 953 9 1 MtM: Marked-to-Market value. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 179 54 Market risk NIBC defines market risk as the current and prospective threat to its earnings and capital as a result of movements in market prices. Market risk, therefore, includes price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, both within and outside the Trading book. For fixed-income products, market risk also includes credit spread risk, which is the risk due to movements of underlying credit curves. The predominant market risk drivers for NIBC are interest rate risk and credit spread risk. Risk appetite For interest rate risk purposes the activities of NIBC can be divided in 3 books: nn The Trading book contains interest rate positions, which are either customer driven or, to a limited extent, proprietary trading. These positions are taken with the purpose to obtain short-term profits. nn The Mismatch book contains the long-term strategic interest rate position of the bank. Positions are limited to currencies in which NIBC has lending activities, i.e. EUR, GBP and USD. nn All other portfolios, jointly referred to as the Banking book, do not contain material interest rate risk, as it is the policy of the bank to concentrate the interest rate risk in either the Trading book or Mismatch book. Risk monitoring and measurement Interest Basis Point Value (BPV), credit BPV, interest Value at Risk (VaR), credit VaR and total VaR measures are calculated on a daily basis and reviewed by the Market Risk department: nn Interest and credit BPV measure the sensitivity of the market value to a change of one basis point in each time bucket of the interest rate curve and credit spread curve, respectively. The BPV as displayed in the tables below represents the sensitivity of the market value to a one-basis-point, parallel upward shift of the underlying curve. A negative amount represents a loss, a positive amount represents a gain; nn The interest VaR, credit spread VaR and total VaR measure the threshold value, which daily marked-to-market losses with a confidence level of 99% will not exceed, based on four years of historical data for weekly changes in interest rates, credit spreads and both simultaneously. For the Trading book, additional VaR scenarios based upon daily historical market data are used, both for limit-setting as well as for the calculation of the capital requirement. VaR as displayed in the tables below is always represented as a positive number, indicating a potential loss; and nn As future market price developments may differ from those that are contained by the four-year history, the risk analysis is complemented by a wide set of scenarios, including scenarios intended as stress testing and vulnerability identification, both based on historical events and on possible future events. Limits are set on all the indicators (BPV and VaR, interest, credit and total). The limits and utilisation are reported to the ALCO once every two weeks. Any significant breach of market risk limits is reported to the CRO immediately. The income statement for the Trading book is also monitored daily. Exposures Interest rate risk in the Trading book The Trading book only consists of books which from a regulatory perspective fall under the market risk treatment. These books only contain interest rate derivatives (swaps, futures and interest rate options). The overall market risk in this book is limited, as is evidenced by the actual level of the VaR. For the whole book a VaR limit of EUR 2.25 million applies. The VaR limit was not exceeded at any time during 2013. 180 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 54-1 Key risk statistics of the Trading book 2013 2012 IN EUR THOUSANDS Interest rate BPV Interest rate VaR Interest rate BPV Interest rate VaR Max 1 (92) 693 (111) 1,337 Average (30) 330 (36) 691 Min 2 1 124 0 231 YEAR-END 14 173 (7) 243 1 Max: value farthest from zero. 2 Min: value closest to zero. The book is primarily used for facilitating derivative transactions with corporate clients. Furthermore activities also comprise position taking in short-term interest rates, money market and bond futures. Basis risk, cross currency spread risk and interest rate spread risk between positions in swaps and bond futures are also taken into account in the VaR. Interest rate risk in the Mismatch book NIBC concentrates the strategic interest rate risk position of NIBC in the Mismatch book. This book exclusively contains swap positions with which a view on future interest rate developments is taken. During 2012, NIBC did not have an open mismatch position. In 2013, NIBC opened a new mismatch position in GBP. 54-2 Key risk statistics of the USD and GBP Mismatch book 2013 2012 IN EUR THOUSANDS Interest rate BPV Interest rate VaR Interest rate BPV Interest rate VaR Max 1 (116) 1,676 (25) 435 Average (43) 663 (17) 321 Min2 (7) 114 (11) 196 YEAR-END (109) 1,510 (11) 210 1 Max: value farthest from zero. 2 Min: value closest to zero. 54-3 Key risk statistics of the EUR Mismatch book 2013 2012 IN EUR THOUSANDS Interest rate BPV Interest rate VaR Interest rate BPV Interest rate VaR Max1 (10) 96 (35) 168 Average (8) 77 (12) 126 Min2 (6) 60 (10) 96 YEAR-END (6) 60 (10) 96 1 Max: value farthest from zero. 2 Min: value closest to zero. Interest rate risk in the Banking book Apart from the Trading book and the Mismatch book, interest rate risk is also present in the following books (henceforth collectively referred to as ‘Banking book’): nn Corporate Treasury Book; nn Debt Investments book; and nn Residential Mortgage book. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 181 The Corporate Treasury book contains the funding activities of NIBC and the Corporate and Investment loan books. The Debt Investments book consists of a legacy structured credits book and retained notes in own securitisations, both with negligible interest rate risk. The interest rate risk on the Residential Mortgage book is also limited, as the interest rate risk is hedged to within small facilitating limits. In the beginning of 2013 NIBC changed the modelling of the on-demand savings. As a consequence of this, the visible interest rate risk in the Corporate Treasury book and hence in the Banking book increased significantly. NIBC decided not to hedge all this interest rate risk at once, but applies a policy to gradually hedge this interest rate risk. Therefore the increase in interest rate risk in the Banking book is temporary and will disappear in the coming years. Tables 54-4 and 54-5 illustrate in EUR the interest rate sensitivity for EUR, USD and GBP in the Trading, Mismatch and Banking books at year-end 2013 and 2012. For other currencies, the interest rate risk is minimal. 54-4 Interest rate statistics, 31 December 2013 BPV IN EUR THOUSANDS Trading Mismatch Banking Total EUR 21 (3) 171 189 USD (2) (10) 9 (3) GBP (5) (102) (19) (126) Other 1 1 TOTAL 14 (115) 162 61 54-5 Interest rate statistics, 31 December 2012 BPV IN EUR THOUSANDS Trading Mismatch Banking Total EUR (10) (3) 90 77 USD 12 (18) 17 11 GBP (9) 19 10 Other 4 4 TOTAL (7) (21) 130 102 Currency risk NIBC manages its overall currency position based on the currency positions in the monthly balance sheets. The main exposures in foreign currencies for NIBC are USD, GBP and JPY. NIBC uses matched funding and other measures to apply its policy of not taking any currency positions. Any currency position which does show at month end is caused by movements in the fair value of assets or liabilities or interest income in foreign currencies and is hedged by entering into FX spot transactions. The visible currency position at month end is the position prior to hedging. The total open foreign currency position, by nominal amount, at month end is typically around EUR 25 million, in accordance with historical figures over the last few years. 182 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 55 Liquidity risk NIBC defines liquidity risk as the inability of NIBC to fund its assets and meet its obligations as they become due, at acceptable cost. Maintaining a sound liquidity and funding profile is one of NIBC’s most important risk management objectives. NIBC analyses its funding profile by mapping all assets and liabilities into time buckets that correspond to their maturities. Based on projections prepared by the business units and reviewed by Risk Management, and the current asset and liability maturity profiles, several liquidity stress tests are prepared and presented once every two weeks to the ALCO, in order to create continuous monitoring of the liquidity position. Assumptions One of the stress scenarios, the market-wide stress test, assumes a world-wide liquidity shortage in which no new market funding can be attracted by NIBC. Furthermore, it is assumed that assets cannot be sold, but that they can only be made liquid by making them eligible for collateralised and ECB funding. In addition, the following assumptions are made: nn In order to maintain NIBC’s business franchise, it is assumed that new corporate loan production continues at a level where the current books are maintained constant; nn Conservative assumptions with respect to for example collateral cash outflows (payments from CSAs) and drawdowns of undrawn commitments are made; and nn A one notch downgrade is assumed. The projection of NIBC’s liquidity in this way is necessarily a subjective process and requires management to make assumptions about, for example, the fair value of eligible collateral and potential outflow of cash collateral placed by NIBC with derivative counterparties. In light of these projections, NIBC is confident that sufficient liquidity is available to meet maturing obligations over the next 12 months. Maturity calendar consolidated balance sheet The following tables present the cash flows payable by NIBC in respect of non-derivative financial liabilities and assets relevant for liquidity risk by the remaining contractual maturities at 31 December. The amounts disclosed in the tables for the non-derivative financial liabilities are contractual undiscounted cash flows. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are therefore restated to nominal amounts. The estimated interest cash flows related to the liabilities are reported on a separate line item. The financial assets relevant for managing liquidity risk are based on the fair value (discounted cash flows) for those assets which are classified at fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale. The differences between the table and the stress scenario are caused mainly by the following items that are included in the stress scenario analysis but not in the maturity calendar of the consolidated balance sheet: nn New asset production; nn Collateralised funding capacity of internal securitisations and individual bonds; and nn Conservative assumptions with respect to possible cash outflows (e.g. CSA collateral, callable funding).

Allocation of capital to the business is based on an EC approach. EC is the amount of capital which NIBC allocates as a buffer against potential losses from business activities, based upon its assessment of risks. The EC that NIBC allocates to each business is based on the assessment of risk of its activities. It differs from Basel II regulatory capital as in certain cases, NIBC assesses the specific risk characteristics of its business activities in a different way from the regulatory method. Total regulatory capital however, in combination with a minimum benchmark Tier-1 ratio, does form a limit to the maximum amount of EC that can be allocated to the business. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 187 Comparing the risk-based EC of each business to its profit delivers a RAROC for each business. EC and RAROC are key tools in NIBC’s capital allocation and usage process, assisting in allocating shareholder’s equity as efficiently as possible, based on expectations of both risks and return. Usage of EC is assessed once every two weeks in the ALCO. The ALCO resets the maximum allocation level of EC to and within each business, taking into account business expectations, NIBC’s desired risk profile and the regulatory requirements. Methodology NIBC uses the business model of each activity as the basis for determining the EC approach. If the business model of an activity is trading, distribution or investing for a limited period, a market risk approach based upon VaR and scaled to a one-year horizon is used to calculate the EC usage. A business model based on ‘buy-to-hold’ or investing to maturity leads to a credit risk approach being applied, based upon estimations of PD and LGD. Add-ons for operational risk and country risk are also calculated. Furthermore, NIBC allocates EC for business risk, reputation risk and model risk on a group-wide level. The EC approach differs from the regulatory approach in which only the trading books are assigned a market risk approach. In the regulatory framework, activities that are not trading but have a business model based on distribution or investment for a limited period are often assigned a credit risk approach, following Basel II regulations or regulatory industry practice, whereas in the EC framework NIBC applies a market risk approach similar to that of the trading activities. Risks and EC are monitored accordingly. The main differences between the EC capital and regulatory framework come from the Residential Mortgage portfolio, the Securitisations portfolio and NIBC’s interest rate mismatch position. EC is determined by a market risk approach for these activities. The regulatory approach is either a credit risk approach (residential mortgages and securitisations) or is not part of the Basel II Pillar 1 at all (mismatch position). Capital allocation NIBC allocates EC to all its business activities in the form of limits set by the ALCO and calculates the amount of EC usage of each business based on the risk of its activities: nn For the Corporate Loan portfolio, NIBC calculates EC usage by means of a credit risk approach largely based upon the Basel II regulatory capital formula and an add-on for concentration risk; nn For the Debt Investments and Trading portfolios, the Residential Mortgage portfolio and the interest rate mismatch position, NIBC uses a market risk approach to determine EC usage. EC usage for these portfolios is calculated using VaR, calculated with four years of historical data and scaled to a one-year horizon; and nn For the Investment loans, NIBC calculates EC usage by applying a credit approach based upon the Basel II regulatory capital formula. NIBC uses fixed percentages for the equity investments. Basel II regulatory capital The objective of Basel II is to improve the capital adequacy of the banking industry by making it more responsive to risk. Basel II is structured on three pillars: nn Pillar 1 describes the capital adequacy requirements for three risk types; credit risk, market risk and operational risk; nn Pillar 2 describes the additional supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), where regulators analyse the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) of the individual banks. Since the end of 2011, DNB also analyses the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP); and nn In Pillar 3 the required risk reporting standards are displayed, supporting additional market discipline in the international capital markets. 188 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Under Basel II and subject to approval from the regulator, banks have the option to choose between various approaches, each with a different level of sophistication in risk management, ranging from ‘standardised’ to ‘advanced’. For credit risk, NIBC adopted the AIRB approach as further specified in Basel II for its corporate and retail exposure classes and is in the process of including institutions. NIBC started using the AIRB approach at 1 January 2008. A small residue of exposures is measured on the standardised approach. For market risk, NIBC adopted an internal model VaR approach. For measuring operational risk, NIBC adopted the standardised approach. The basis for Pillar 2 is NIBC’s ICAAP, which is NIBC’s self-assessment of risks not captured by Pillar 1. Pillar 3 is related to market discipline and complements the operation of Pillars 1 and 2, aiming to make banks more transparent. NIBC publishes its Pillar 3 disclosures on its website. The following table displays the composition of regulatory capital as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012. NIBC complies with DNB’s Basel II capital requirements, which formally require a minimum Tier-1 ratio of 4.5% and a BIS ratio of 8%.

All amounts not receivable on demand are mandatory reserve deposits with central banks which are not available for use in NIBC’s day-to-day operations. Balances held with central banks are interest bearing. The fair value of this balance sheet item does not materially deviate from its face value, due to the shortterm nature of the underlying assets. 198 Notes to the company financial statements 2 Due from other banks IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 Current accounts 131 230 Deposits with other banks 1,375 1,568 Due from group companies 10 580 1,516 2,378 DUE FROM OTHER BANKS CAN BE CATEGORISED AS FOLLOWS: Receivable on demand 141 810 Cash collateral placements posted under CSA agreements 1,231 1,474 Not receivable on demand 144 94 1,516 2,378 THE LEGAL MATURITY ANALYSIS OF DUE FROM OTHER BANKS NOT RECEIVABLE ON DEMAND IS AS FOLLOWS: Three months or less 138 78 Longer than three months but not longer than one year 5 Longer than one year but not longer than five years 2 7 Longer than five years 4 4 144 94 There were no subordinated loans outstanding due from other banks in 2013 and 2012. The fair value of this balance sheet item does not materially deviate from its face value due to the short-term nature of the underlying assets and the credit quality of the counterparties. Other than from group companies, NIBC does not have receivables from other participating interests. No impairments were recorded in 2013 and 2012 on the amounts due from other banks. An amount of EUR 1,231 million (2012: EUR 1,474 million) relates to cash collateral given to third parties and was not freely available to NIBC. NIBC transacted several reverse repurchase transactions with third parties. The related disclosures are included in note 20 Repurchase and resale agreements and transferred financial assets.

The total amount of loans in the available-for-sale category net of impairments was reclassified to the loans category at amortised cost as at 1 July 2008. The impairments at 31 December 2013, related to the available-for-sale loans reclassified to the loans category at amortised cost on 1 July 2008, amounted to EUR 28 million (31 December 2012: EUR 69 million). If NIBC had fair valued the loans classified as amortised cost using the valuation methodology applied to loans designated as available-for-sale as per 31 December 2013, then the carrying amount would have decreased at the balance sheet date by EUR 58 million (2012: EUR 150 million) excluding group companies. This decrease would reflect both changes due to interest rates and credit spreads. NIBC hedges its interest rate risk from these assets. The maximum credit risk exposure including undrawn credit facilities arising on loans at amortised cost amounts to EUR 6,649 million (2012: EUR 7,632 million), excluding the group companies. The total amount of subordinated loans in this item was EUR 57 million in 2013 (2012: EUR 91 million), of which nil (2012: nil) has been guaranteed by the Dutch State. No subordinated loans are included with respect to group companies. As per 31 December 2013, EUR 12 million (2012: EUR 34 million) was guaranteed by the Dutch State. For the impact of the reclassifications following IASB amendments ‘IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurements’ on the income statement and on shareholder’s equity, see notes to the consolidated financial statements 2013 of NIBC. Impairment losses of loans at amortised cost are measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. As a policy, NIBC does not provide loans to its executives. 200 Notes to the company financial statements 4 Interest-bearing securities IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 Amortised cost 523 560 Available-for-sale 1,300 985 Fair value through profit or loss 50 72 Held for trading 31 49 1,904 1,666 The previous table displays the IFRS accounting treatment of interest bearing securities.

Interest-bearing securities do not include assets issued and bought by NIBC for market making purposes. Any such assets are eliminated from the balance sheet. Interest income from interest-bearing securities and other fixed-income instruments is recognised in interest and similar income at the effective interest rate. Fair value movements (excluding interest) are recognised in net trading income. The portion of fair value changes in 2013 included in the balance sheet amount (designated at fair value through profit or loss) at 31 December 2013 relating to the movement in credit spreads amounted to EUR 1 million debit, being an increase in the carrying amount of the asset (2012: EUR 1 million debit, being an increase in the carrying amount). If NIBC had fair valued the interest bearing securities classified as amortised cost, then the balance sheet amount would have decreased at the balance sheet date by EUR 105 million (2012: EUR 59 million). This decrease reflects both changes due to interest rates and credit spreads. Annual Report 2013 NIBC Bank N.V. 201 In 2013, impairments on interest bearing assets amounted to EUR 2 million (2012: EUR 6 million). As at 1 July 2008, certain debt investments from the available-for-sale and held for trading category were reclassified to debt investments at amortised cost.

With respect to unrealised fair value gains arising on these instruments, a legal reserve has been established of EUR 202 million (2012: EUR 241 million) that is included in retained earnings. At the balance sheet date, for associates accounted for based on net equity method, no further legal reserve has been established for both 2013 and 2012.

Outstanding loan commitments have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement period of one to three months. Commitments extended to customers relating to mortgages at fixed-interest rates or fixed spreads are hedged with interest rate swaps recorded at fair value. These commitments are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. NIBC provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers to third parties. These agreements have fixed limits and generally extend for a period up to five years. Expirations are not concentrated in any period. The contractual amounts of commitments (excluding residential mortgages commitments which are measured at fair value through profit or loss) and contingent liabilities are set out in the following table by category. In the table, it is assumed that amounts are fully advanced. The amounts for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum accounting loss that would be recognised at the balance sheet date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted. IN EUR MILLIONS 2013 2012 CONTRACT AMOUNT: Undrawn facilities and capital commitments 906 1,068 Guarantees and letters of credit 104 128 1,010 1,196 In 2013 and 2012, there were no guarantees to group companies. These commitments and contingent liabilities have off-balance sheet credit risk because only commitment/ origination fees and accruals for probable losses are recognised in the balance sheet until the commitments are fulfilled or expire. Many of the contingent liabilities and commitments will expire without being advanced in whole or in part. Therefore, the amounts do not represent expected future cash flows. 216 Notes to the company financial statements Details of concentrations of credit risk including concentrations of credit risk arising from commitments and contingent liabilities as well as NIBC’s policies for collateral for loans are set out in note 54 of the consolidated financial statements.

Managing Board’s responsibility The Managing Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Report of the Managing Board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the Managing Board is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Managing Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Audit procedures focus on obtaining reasonable assurance, substantiated by sufficient and appropriate supporting audit evidence. Our most important audit procedures for the selected 13 NFK figures, amongst others, were: • assessing the acceptability of the materiality analysis performed by NIBC in order to determine the in-scope key non-financial indicators; • assessing the acceptability of the reporting policies and consistent application of this, such as assessment of the reasonableness of estimates made by Management; • evaluating the systems and processes for data gathering, internal controls and processing of information, such as the aggregation process of data to the information as presented in the key non-financial indicators table; • evaluating internal and external documentation to determine whether the key non-financial indicators are adequately substantiated; and • evaluating the consistency of disclosures regarding the key non-financial indicators in the Annual Report. We believe that the information we have obtained from our audit is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Opinion Based on our audit procedures performed, in our opinion the NFK figures for the year 2013 as presented on page 224 of the Annual Report 2013 and their related disclosures are, in all material respects, presented reliably and adequately, in accordance with NIBC’s reporting criteria. Basis of preparation and selection of the selected NFK figures Without qualifying our opinion we draw your attention to page 225 of NIBC’s 2013 Annual Report, which describes that the NFK figures as presented on page 224 of the Annual Report do not provide a complete overview of all sustainability information of NIBC. We have not been engaged to perform any procedures on the other indicators and information in NIBC’s 2013 Annual Report. Consequently we do not report on NIBC’s 2013 Annual Report other than the indicated NFK figures. Use of this report This assurance report has been prepared in accordance with our engagement for the Managing Board of NIBC and is published for information purposes only.
