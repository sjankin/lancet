UN ITED NATIONS INTRODUCTION TO GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT ON PROGRESS STATUS ON SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS DECEMBER 2014 LABOUR RIGHTS ENVIRONMENT ANTI-CORRUPTION NORDIC BUILT CHARTER COLOPHON INTRODUCTION TO HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS 2 INTRODUCTION TO Henning Larsen Architects is an international architecture company. Our goal is to create vibrant, HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS sustainable projects that reach beyond themselves and become of durable value to the user and to the society and culture into which they are built. The company has offices in Denmark, The Faroe STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Islands, Norway, Germany, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong. Henning Larsen Architects employs 270 people (as of 1 December 2014) across the seven offices. STATUS ON SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS The projects are characterised by a high degree of social responsibility – not only in relation to materials and production but also as regards good, social spaces which encourage intimacy and community. LABOUR RIGHTS We shape, challenge and change the physical environment with the overall objective of providing the user with a strong, visionary and thoroughly framed design adapted to the specific context. ENVIRONMENT ANTI-CORRUPTION Henning Larsen Architects attaches great importance to designing environmentally friendly and energy-efficient solutions. Our ideas are developed in close collaboration with the client, users and NORDIC BUILT CHARTER partners in order to achieve long-lasting buildings with strong life-cycle economies. This value-based approach is the key to our design of numerous building projects around the world – from complex COLOPHON masterplans to architectural landmarks. A diverse staff The employees at Henning Larsen Architects are a diverse group. As of 1 December 2014, the staff represents 36 different nationalities of which 56 % are men and 44 % are women. To promote a better understanding across cultures, Henning Larsen Architects seeks to attract interns and employees from different countries.

STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT 3 INTRODUCTION TO Henning Larsen Architects continues to support the United Nations Global Compact and encourages HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS our network to participate and implement its principles. STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Since we joined the United Nations Global Compact, we have put our efforts into promoting sustainability in the planning, design and operation of our building projects. This is within our sphere of STATUS ON SUPPORT influence. We engage in research projects with universities and partnerships with private and public HUMAN RIGHTS stakeholders. New insight and results are actively communicated to a broad audience within the building sector – from apprentices to clients and lawmakers. LABOUR RIGHTS In our efforts to develop a global presence, Henning Larsen Architects opened a Hong Kong office in ENVIRONMENT 2014. Across global markets, there is a growing demand for a responsible approach to architecture ANTI-CORRUPTION and sustainable buildings. Being present enables us to share know-how and solutions across offices and countries and apply them on projects globally. In the coming years, knowledge-sharing will be a NORDIC BUILT CHARTER priority, and we are developing our knowledge base through two ongoing research projects. COLOPHON To promote a construction sector which understands how sustainability can create long-term societal and economic value, we continue to invest in research and development projects. Currently, we are involved in a three-year-long research project, ‘Urban Environment: Development of comfort criteria for urban planning’ in collaboration with the Technical University of Denmark. The second research project is in collaboration with The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture, and was launched in December 2014. Over the next three years, this project will examine the significance of light—both natural and artificial—in learning environments. The primary focus will be to reach a better understanding of how light can contribute to better learning environments. While maintaining our focus on sustainability, we are aware of other aspects in our global projects that can be challenging due to different ethical standards, cultural values, spiritual concepts or political systems. We work to develop a systematic approach to collecting knowledge of these aspects and continue to work globally with projects in countries where architecture can have a significant impact on the development of society. Mette Kynne Frandsen CEO and Partner, Henning Larsen Architects STATUS ON SUPPORT 4 INTRODUCTION TO Henning Larsen Architects joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2008, to be a part of the HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS partnership between the UN and the international corporate world with the objective of promoting the social commitment of businesses. This report is our fifth Communication on Progress (CoP) in STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT which we address and renew our commitment to all four areas of the Global Compact: Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. STATUS ON SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS Our Communication on Progress is uploaded to the website of the United Nations Global Compact and will also be available on our website, intranet and be an integral part of how we present our LABOUR RIGHTS company internally and in the media. In this approach, we transparently communicate our ethical standards and values, and we hope that our efforts and results will be inspirational and raise awareENVIRONMENT ness among employees, colleagues, partners and clients. ANTI-CORRUPTION In architecture, the environment is the field where companies within the industry can make the NORDIC BUILT CHARTER greatest difference. Our projects reflect this premise; they are based on a holistic approach to sustainability and – to a high degree – on the knowledge built by Henning Larsen Architects and our COLOPHON collaboration partners. Promoting cross-cultural meetings In 2014, Henning Larsen Architects contributed to the exhibition CONTEMPORARY ARAB at Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark. The exhibition focused on our work with the public realm in an Arab context. An installation by Henning Larsen Architects featured a spatial installation filtering the light in a play between light and shadow.

STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT The initiative aims to develop and strengthen collaboration across the building sector to raise the STATUS ON SUPPORT standards for labour conditions, sustainability and stakeholder dialogue. The association is supHUMAN RIGHTS ported by the Realdania fourndation. LABOUR RIGHTS The platform for the association is a charter comprising six principles: ENVIRONMENT 1 – We will systematically assess to what extent the principles of the charter are followed on projects ANTI-CORRUPTION in which we are involved. 2 – We will assess our collaborators’ and suppliers’ work with social responsibility. NORDIC BUILT CHARTER 3 – We will enter into dialogue with collaborators and stakeholders. 4 – We aim for sustainable solutions. COLOPHON 5 – We have good conditions of employment and work. 6 – We demonstrate independent and anti-corrupt practice. HUMAN RIGHTS 6 INTRODUCTION TO Principle 1 HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Principle 2 Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. STATUS ON SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS Our commitment Henning Larsen Architects supports the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and LABOUR RIGHTS the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. ENVIRONMENT Actions taken ANTI-CORRUPTION Henning Larsen Architects complies with the provisions of national Danish legislation, which are aligned with international conventions on human rights. NORDIC BUILT CHARTER In addition to our commitment to prevent a negative impact on human rights, we actively support COLOPHON and promote the enjoyment of human rights – by the projects in which we choose to engage, by the way we design projects and by our recruitment and employment policy, including internship programs. A widespread issue when operating an international organisation in today’s globalised economy, is the lack of legislation and cultural traditions that do not have the same standards as – or even contradict – Danish legislation. We strive to support the local improvement of human rights. HUMAN RIGHTS 7 INTRODUCTION TO Responsible design HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS One of our main business activities is the design of cultural and educational buildings. By their very nature, these buildings are necessarily supportive of human rights and development. Our designs STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT embody a high degree of social responsibility – not only in relation to sustainability, the selection of materials and production, but also as regards inclusive social spaces which encourage equality and STATUS ON SUPPORT community. HUMAN RIGHTS A frontrunner in the educational sector LABOUR RIGHTS The new SDU, the University of Southern Denmark, in Kolding, Denmark, is characterised by its focus on quality in every detail – as regards design, technique and craft. Daylight, human scale and dynamic ENVIRONMENT spaces are key elements in the building’s design. It is an example of new thinking and contains a ANTI-CORRUPTION number of innovative solutions, e.g. an intelligent façade and temperature adjusting concrete. NORDIC BUILT CHARTER The spatial organsation encourages knowledge-sharing and social interaction across the organisation. The atrium constitutes a large common and synergy-creating space which promotes formal and COLOPHON informal meetings. The building opens up towards the city and is designed as an integrated part of the surrounding society. Studying in open space SDU, the University of Southern Denmark, in Kolding, Denmark, opened in September 2014. The new buidling supports different teaching and learning methods, new ways of teaching and is a flexible, open and state-of-the-art teaching environment.

STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Principle 4 STATUS ON SUPPORT Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 5 LABOUR RIGHTS Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. ENVIRONMENT Principle 6 ANTI-CORRUPTION Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. NORDIC BUILT CHARTER Our commitment Henning Larsen Architects supports the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental COLOPHON Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Actions taken The Danish labour market is largely self-regulated by collective agreements concluded between trade unions and employers’ organisations and, to a lesser degree, statutorily regulated by the state and EU bodies. Henning Larsen Architects participates in, respects and supports this system through our membership in the Danish Association of Architectural Firms, which collaborates with The Danish Union of Salaried Architects and the Danish Architects’ Association. These organisations safeguard and balance individual and commercial interests as regards collective bargaining, legislation concerning salaried employees, labour market, industrial and educational policies etc. Through collaborative efforts, Henning Larsen Architects upholds the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. The international offices of Henning Larsen Architects are subsidairies and comply with local legislation and collective agreements. All employees are offered the opportunity for further training. This is a requirement according to the Danish collective agreement, but the staff outside Denmark are also offered further training. ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT 10 INTRODUCTION TO Principle 7 HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Principle 8 Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. STATUS ON SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 9 Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technoloLABOUR RIGHTS gies. ENVIRONMENT Our commitment ANTI-CORRUPTION Henning Larsen Architects is committed to protecting the environment through adoption of voluntary charters as well as through sectoral and international initiatives, including Nordic Built and NORDIC BUILT CHARTER Concito, the green think-tank of Denmark. COLOPHON Actions taken Henning Larsen Architects supports scientific research. The environmental impact of existing building stock as well as that of new buildings must be reduced. Incorporating scientific knowledge on climate and energy into the design process adds a new quality to architectural design. Cross-disciplinary collaborations within Henning Larsen Architects have dealt with both existing knowledge and new research – with the primary objective of promoting a holistic appreciation of the environmental and energy-related aspects of building. An important step has been taken in terms of bringing together professions that usually work separately. Knowledge of and access to state-of-the-art knowledge and developments are decisive factors in relation to architecture. Therefore, Henning Larsen Architects takes part in building, collecting and sharing new knowledge about sustainability. Henning Larsen Architects currently employs two industrial PhD students conducting their research within the office. In collaboratin with the Technical University of Denmark, one PhD student conducts research on urban environments and the development of measurable and quantifiable comfort criteria for urban planning. In collaboration with The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts’ School of Architecture, the other PhD student conducts research on improving learning environments through lighting. ENVIRONMENT 11 INTRODUCTION TO Life Cycle Assessment HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS Henning Larsen Architects acted as knowledge partner on a new catalogue concerning the use of sustainable materials with a long lifespan. The catalogue was compiled by the Danish Building STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Research Institute and functions as an reference tool in the selection of building components. STATUS ON SUPPORT One hundred of the most common composite materials used in both new construction and renoHUMAN RIGHTS vation was assessed according to its lifecycle. LABOUR RIGHTS Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) evaluates the products from cradle to grave: from the extraction of raw materials and natural resources, through the production and use of the product. This ENVIRONMENT includes maintenance and reparations, and furthermore considers the final disposal and possible ANTI-CORRUPTION reuse of the discarded product. NORDIC BUILT CHARTER COLOPHON Sustainable materials The less strain on the environment, the longer the lifespan of construction materials, and the easier it is to reuse, the better the assessment of the material is in relation to sustainability.

With STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT the project “Retelling Bellahøj,” the team is developing a vision for renovating and upgrading the residential complex. STATUS ON SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS The strategy considers all levels from the houses in general to the connection with the rest of the city, as well as the details on each building. Architectonically, the connection between the buildings LABOUR RIGHTS as well as their individual characteristics will be recreated or enhanced, while maintaining the feeling of an integrated whole. ENVIRONMENT ANTI-CORRUPTION The team consists of Henning Larsen Architects, Erik Møller Arkitekter, GHB Landskabsarkitekter, Orbicon and Rekommanderet. NORDIC BUILT CHARTER COLOPHON Retelling Bellahøj The vision for the renovation of the Bellahøj Houses is not only to upgrade the buildings to healthy and low-energy housing but also to recreate Bellahøj as a residential area with a strong identity – a place where the residents feel proud to live and others dream of living.

STATUS ON SUPPORT Detailed wind simulations of the platform have been conducted in order to ensure that the partiallyHUMAN RIGHTS open platform does not lead to extreme wind patterns. Wind analyses have been conducted on the landscape bridge and on the planned building volumes surrounding the station. These analyses have LABOUR RIGHTS informed the refinement of the design and minimised the disturbance of strong winds. ENVIRONMENT The form will be constructed of in-situ concrete. Rain water is channeled by gutters which are ANTI-CORRUPTION integrated into the surface and will be collected in tanks at the edges of the building. This overall drainage strategy ensures a dry and anti-slip surface that does not compromise the aesthetics of the NORDIC BUILT CHARTER structure. COLOPHON In addition, the long life-span of concrete will contribute to an economically sustainable city space for many years. Optimised microclimate One of the intentions of the elliptical bowl-shaped design of the new regional train station in Vinge is to protect people on the platform by diverting the wind prevailing south-westerly across the building. The partially-covered platform offers commuters protection from sun, rain and snow.

The material will focus on essential STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT components of sustainability parameters such as daylight, materials, energy use and indoor climate— all crucial considerations in sustainable building. STATUS ON SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS Craftsmen are the direct and consulting link for private homeowners when they renovate or build new houses. That makes them a key information channel to increase knowledge about sustainable buildLABOUR RIGHTS ing among private homeowners. ENVIRONMENT In the first phase of the project’s development, Henning Larsen Architects will identify needs, existANTI-CORRUPTION ing knowledge and knowledge gaps among teachers and students. Subsequently, the development of the educational material will be initiated, and scheduled for completion in 2015.
