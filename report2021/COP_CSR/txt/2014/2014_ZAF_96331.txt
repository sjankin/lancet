Net jewellery demand was up slightly by 20koz. Supply fell by 4.5% to 5.59Moz. 2014 The outlook for 2014 points to industrial demand remaining strong and the new Euro 6 diesel emission standards in Europe should boost demand due to higher metal loadings per vehicle. The outlook for jewellery demand is also robust, with potential for growth in platinum jewellery in both China and India. Sales of platinum ETFs are not expected to reach 2013’s record level. Prices are expected to remain flat in 2014 but are expected to rise China is the world’s from 2015. Primary platinum supply is unlikely to grow significantly in 2014. biggest consumer of platinum (33% of new metal purchases in 2013) Source: SFA (Oxford) 9 Platinum group metals (PGMs) are critical to improving air quality. They have a unique set of properties that convert exhaust pollutant emissions from combustion engines to harmless compounds and accordingly have been the main metals used in catalytic converters to date. More vehicles globally must have cleaner emissions, so there will be a growing need for PGMs in future. Several other metals are good oxidation catalysts in other environments but do not have the thermal durability and resistance to poisoning necessary to survive in the harsh autocatalytic conditions. Platinum has the widest range of end uses, with autocatalysts comprising 43% of consumption and jewellery 37% in 2013. Chinese jewellery now makes up 26% of total platinum demand and India, the world’s largest gold jewellery market, is fast warming to platinum. Platinum is the metal of choice in a wide range of smaller industrial markets too. Palladium demand is increasingly dominated by its use in autocatalysts, where it forms the bulk of all light-duty gasoline autocatalysts and also plays an increasing role in diesel autocatalysts, while rhodium is almost entirely used in autocatalysts.

The gap Demand growth for between palladium supply and demand increased during 2013 with primary palladium is based on supplies declining to 6.27Moz due to lower Russian stock sales. strong new car sales Recycling grew by 8.1% to 2.11Moz. A return to boom conditions in growth led by China the Chinese car market lifted global palladium usage in autocatalysts by 4.9% to 6.95Moz. 2014 Higher demand for palladium from the automotive industry is expected to continue in 2014, while the reduction in primary supply in the absence of Russian stock sales will be partially offset by additional recycling. Palladium demand is increasingly dominated by autocatalysts, as the largely gasoline markets in the faster growing countries catch up rapidly with emissions legislation. RHODIUM 2013 Autocatalyst demand In 2013, global demand for rhodium rose by 4.5% to 960koz. While supply decreased by 9.1% to 680koz as UG2 production was trimmed returns to growth further, the market remains closely balanced and is currently well stocked. The reduction in the basket price, combined with rising unit costs, has resulted in an unsustainable erosion of margins for a number of smaller-scale, narrow-reef UG2 producers. 2014 The introduction of Euro 6 legislation for new models from September 2014 will result in the measurable use of rhodium in diesel catalysts for the first time. Historically, the use of rhodium in light duty Global gross diesel vehicles has been almost non-existent because it is mainly used in light duty demand for gasoline vehicles. Supplies of rhodium are expected to show a modest increase during 2014 with the increased recoveries from scrapped autocatalysts being a rhodium major contributor to this increase. rose by 4.5% to 960koz, the highest since 2008 Source: SFA (Oxford) 11 Gross Demand for PALLADIUM BY INDUSTRY Gross Demand for PALLADIUM BY REGION PALLADIUM supply BY REGION 10 10 10 Moz 5 5 Moz 5 Moz 0 0 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Auto incl. off-road Chemica l Dental North America Western Europe Japan South Africa Russia North America Jewellery Electrica l Others China Rest of the world Zimbabwe Others Source: SFA (Oxford) Source: SFA (Oxford) Source: SFA (Oxford) Gross Rhodium demand BY INDUSTRY Rhodium supply BY REGION 1.0 1.0 Moz 0.5 Moz 0.5 0 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Auto Chemical Glass South Africa Russia North America Others Zimbabwe Others Source: SFA (Oxford) Source: SFA (Oxford) 12 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Annual Report 2013 Operating context (continued) 2014 real GDP forecast for the developed world (revised downwards due to slower than expected recovery) Global economic 4.0 conditions 3.7 3.5 3.3 3.0 2.8 Demand for virgin PGMs 2.5 2.6 affected by global % change 2.0 economic conditions 2.0 1.8 1.6 1.5 1.0 0.9 0.5 Jul 12 Oct 12 Jan 13 Apri 13 Jul 13 Oct 13 Eurozone Japan United States World Legislation Source: SFA (Oxford), Oxford Economics The roll-out of global emissions legislation continues relatively unabated, underpinning 2014 real GDP forecast for EMERGING MARKETS (revised downwards due to slower than expected recovery) PGM demand.

Developments in the macro-economic environment, combined with continued industry cost escalations, have impacted adversely on operating margins placing increased emphasis on the importance of cash preservation, the operating margin of UG2-based operations and the availability of alternative concentrating options for Styldrift I. Implementation of our social and labour plans (SLPs) If the implementation of our SLPs, which are part of RBPlat’s commitment in terms of the Mining Charter, was inadequate this could result in disgruntled employees and community members, protest action, violence against our operations and the withdrawal of our mining rights by the DMR. It could also lead to RBPlat losing its social licence to operate, the cessation of our operations and the potential loss of our mining investment and development opportunity. 23 How we responded to the risks and opportunities this issue raised previously and 2013 risk during 2013 Future outlook Impact rating The three-year wage agreement we concluded in 2011 has In 2014 we need to renegotiate the 3 provided predictability and the incentive to improve productivity wage agreement we have with our levels included in the agreement has been effective. permanent employees.

They also wanted more information on our share scheme plans. We need to ensure that the performance of our managers and executives is measured and rewarded in terms of a combination of business and individual key performance measurements, which include financial and non-financial performance indicators. We have a production bonus structure in place for employees at BRPM which is working well. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND GROW ORGANICALLY Operating context on page 8 to Global economic and market conditions 17 (global economic and market conditions) The global economy and market conditions can have a positive or negative impact on our earnings. Low platinum group metals (PGM) demand in major markets as a result of a sluggish global economy and depressed PGM prices have had a negative impact on our revenue for some time. Currency fluctuations can also reduce our earnings and cash flow. This year the weak performance of the rand against the US dollar worked in our favour and increased our earnings. Styldrift I project management The completion of a project, like our Styldrift I project, can be affected by many things including construction delays, a change in scope, the failure of contractors and insufficient electricity to support mining and processing functions. If we are unable to complete our Styldrift I project on time it will have a negative impact on our reputation, costs, future revenues and our ability to achieve our organic growth strategy. Human capital section on page 66 to 83 (safety performance, labour and trade union stability, implementation of human resource development element of social and labour plans, availability of adequate and appropriate skills) Availability of adequate and appropriate skills While ensuring we have adequate and appropriate skills available to meet production targets remains a material issue for us, it is not currently a critical issue. 25 How we responded to the risks and opportunities this issue raised previously and 2013 risk during 2013 Future outlook Impact rating During 2013 we refined and restructured our executive We will continue to refine and modify 12 remuneration and reward structures in terms of the our remuneration and reward measurement of performance against a scorecard that structures to ensure they support our measures specific business and individual financial and strategies and are linked to non-financial performance targets.

Stock Exchange Limited (JSE) and a Constituent of the JSE SRI index Long-term high-grade In 2000 70% of South Africa’s PGM production was derived from mining Merensky reef 2 Merensky resource and 30% was derived from UG2 reef. Today, because of the depletion of the Merensky reef approximately 30% of total PGM production is derived from the Merensky reef horizon with the balance made up mostly through the extraction of UG2. Current market conditions favour the extraction of Merensky reef due to its more favourable PGM prill split and natural PGM hedge (attributable to its higher base metal contribution) when compared to UG2. RBPlat has the advantage of having access to 108 million tonnes of Merensky resource at 7.37g/t 4E through the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine (BRPM) Joint Venture, and with Styldrift I set to reach full production in 2019, our operations will remain Merensky biased for the foreseeable future. Long-term shallow RBPlat is mining BRPM at an average depth of 500 metres and Styldrift I will be mined at 3 depth mining (>60an average depth of 740 metres. The industry’s average depth for new shafts is 1 500 metres. The BRPM Joint Venture has a total 4E resource base of 72.4Moz (57.6Moz year life of mine) measured and indicated) giving a life of mine in excess of 60 years. Competitive position The graph on page 15 shows how well our existing BRPM operation is positioned on the industry cost curve. By 2019 50% of our production will be low-cost mechanised mining. 4 on the industry cost curve Maximising existing Since taking over management of BRPM in 2010 we have increased our operational 5 assets flexibility by increasing our immediately stopable reserves (IMS), (see the Manufactured capital section on page 54), contained costs (see Financial capital on page 46 and Intellectual capital on page 114), improved our safety record (see pages 54 and 79) and focused on maintaining the sustainability of the business in the short, medium and long term. Growing organically Currently, RBPlat is one of the few platinum companies investing in growth. 6 Our R11.0 billion Styldrift I expansion project (using mechanised mining) will increase our production by 2019, in line with our revised ore processing strategy and prevailing market conditions. Styldrift II (still under exploration) is set to contribute further to our organic growth. Strong cash flows To date our organic growth capital expenditure has predominantly been funded from our 7 cash flows. In 2013 we generated sufficient cash from our operations to cover most of our capital expenditure during the year. Labour and trade We currently have a three-year wage agreement in place, which expires in June 2014, and 8 union stability the improvement to our production bonus structure we agreed on in 2012 has worked well in 2013.

Permanent employees decreased by 11.9% and contractors increased by 1.5%. Stakeholder responsiveness Our key stakeholders in terms of human resources are our employees, union representatives and the communities in which we operate. We have identified a breakdown in relationships with our workforce (permanent employees and contractors) as one of our potential key risks. We have implemented a communication plan designed to provide our employees with regular, transparent communication and a mutual understanding of issues. While we recognise that human resource communication will always be a challenge, we are committed to doing our best to maintain good relationships with our workforce, the unions and the communities. Our Chief Executive Officer plays an important role in our employee engagement and he has regular meetings at which he interacts with employee focus groups throughout the year. Any issues raised at these meetings are recorded to ensure that, if required, they receive attention and a response where necessary. Where possible the CEO responds during the meeting. We keep employees updated on business issues through a range of communication tools, including our quarterly Lebone newsletter and our annual report to employees, partnership forums, the monthly feedback sessions held by the general manager and the operational area production managers, and cellphone text messages. To improve workgroup communication the leadership training we provide includes training in communication skills. Our most key stakeholder engagement in terms of human resources this year has been our discussions with the United Association of South Africa (UASA) and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which represents the majority of our employees, around employee housing and the restructuring of our workforce to improve our cost effectiveness, which started in 2012. In 2014 our key engagement with the union will be our wage agreement negotiations and the allocation of houses. We interact with trade union representatives both via formal structures and informally. Formal operational area partnership forums take place once a month at each shaft or plant, while the operational unit partnership forums meet quarterly at each mine. We also have an executive partnership forum (EPF), which meets twice a year, at which our executives provide the local, regional and national union representatives with a high level business review. 69 The issues raised in these structures include representation in the supervisory unit.

We defined what skills would be required to fill a certain position and identified the skills people in lower level positions would need to develop before they would qualify for promotion. This exercise has provided us with a skills matrix that we can use, together with performance management assessments, to ensure the training and development we provide our employees is appropriate to their developmental needs.

We identified that there was a need to develop the leadership skills of our heads of department, team leaders, miners and supervisors. Team leaders’ legal responsibilities have increased in recent years and we found that they needed assistance with managing these responsibilities. Together with the key performance management indicators introduced for teams we introduced an integrated process which includes coaching, analysis of data collected from observing teams at work followed by training in planning, organising, leading and controlling a team, which is based on the data collected from observing teams at work. The introduction of our talent management programme in 2014 will ensure our leaders are receiving the type of training that will help them develop the skills they need in their current and future roles in the organisation. Not only will this make our training more effective, it will also be more cost efficient. Skills development Our Rock Drill Operators Academy gives unemployed youths who completed our ABET and portable skills programme an opportunity to train in the full complement of mining skills. Their practical training takes place in our underground training centre. They train teams because teamwork plays a very important role in safe and productive mining. The first intake in 2012 proved so successful that a second intake of 55 youths were enrolled on the programme in 2013. Eighteen women who came from the local communities joined our rock drill operator training programme last year. Ten of these women were also multiskilled in pipes, tracks and ventilation (PTV) and stope timber. One of our contracting companies was so impressed with the standard of our Rock Drill Operators Academy trainees that they have hired 52 of them. 75 candidates. We have since expanded our Community development university entrance an opportunity to recruiting to other communities in this area. To address the need for more learners to improve their marks.

The principle relevant to health and wellness is: Human rights Principle one: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights within their sphere of influence. Our previous report on the progress we have made in terms of the Compact’s ten principles is available on our website at: www.bafokengplatinum.co.za For information on our community health initiatives, see page 89. 81 Our approach to health and wellness RBPlat complies with the requirements of the South African Mine Health and Safety Act. The new health and wellness strategy was finalised in 2012 and was introduced in 2013, together with the necessary policies, processes and procedures. We aim to eliminate occupational diseases by providing a workplace free from health and hygiene hazards. Occupational health and hygiene policies, standards, monitoring and auditing are the responsibility of our SHE department and line management is responsible for maintaining occupational health and hygiene standards. Platinum Health is responsible for our healthcare delivery and medical surveillance. RBPlat is committed to improving the wellbeing of our employees and contractors. We recognise that having a healthy workforce is an advantage to our business, because it means that our employees are fit to work at their full potential and absences due to sickness are reduced.

It also provides our workplace wellness programmes which include disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, management and rehabilitation and HIV/Aids management. Noise-induced hearing loss NIHL, which can have a long latency period, is the most common occupational health issue in our operations. The mining sector, RBPlat included, is striving to eliminate cases of a shift in hearing loss of more than 10% resulting from exposure to noise at work. Engineering advances to equipment, training at induction, rated hearing protection devices and a hearing conservation programme all contribute to the achievement of this aim. At the RBPlat medical centre we address early hearing loss movement as early as a 2.5% move in hearing loss from the baseline assessment. A formal investigation is undertaken following a 2.5% shift or more in hearing loss. In line with the 2013 milestones NIHL is not solely a workplace issue. It can also be caused by activities outside the workplace. related to health, RBPlat is The key is for people to avoid exposure to high noise levels on and off the job. According to committed to no shift of more the World Health Organisation, NIHL is the most common permanent and preventable than 10% in NIHL as a result of occupational illness in the world. Due to its high prevalence and significant consequences on working at an RBPlat operation quality of life, especially in the later years of life, hearing loss is one of only four non-fatal conditions among the 20 leading causes of the global burden of disease. after 2013. The noise in any of our working places will not Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) statistics exceed 110 dBa. Instances of NIHL 2013 2012* 2011 NIHL of more than 10% which qualifies for compensation 13 11 19** NIHL of more than 10% that does not qualify for compensation 14 20 16 Total 27 31 35 * In 2012 we hired a number of new employees and contractors who were found to have NIHL prior to being employed at RBPlat ** The shift in hearing of more than 10% experienced by this group was an accumulation of industry exposure over their working years and not as result of working at RBPlat People of all ages can develop hearing loss, however, old age is known to significantly influence one’s hearing loss. The average age in the mining industry for people to display some hearing loss is 40 years. At RBPlat our average age is 43 years. Studies have also shown that some people are predisposed to hearing loss even when they are only exposed to moderate levels of noise. The burden of the HIV disease and the impacts of the disease manifestations, coupled with the treatment regimes, have in the recent past distorted the number of hearing loss cases as it also causes hearing loss. NIHL is preventable. We all need to understand the hazards of noise exposure and how to practise good hearing health in everyday life. The Mine Health and Safety Act accepts 85 decibels as the acceptable safe noise level for exposure during an eight-hour work day without ear protection. A drill used in a mine can generate noise levels of over 105 decibels. Mining, and in particular operating a drill, remains one of the most hazardous occupations in the world; both in terms of injuries and in terms of long-term impacts such as NIHL. A very good hearing conservation programme is required to ensure exposed employees are not affected. At RBPlat we are committed to a vision of zero harm. We embrace a workplace culture that recognises NIHL is preventable. We strive to prevent repeat occurrences of occupational disease and promote the setting and implementing of consistent standards to prevent NIHL and other occupational illness. Tuberculosis Another area of concern is TB, both among our workforce and in the community. While TB, which is an infection, is not classified as an occupational disease, working in an environment, such as a mining environment where ventilation air is reused, it can increase a person’s susceptibility to TB. 83 TB statistics % change 2013 2012 2011 year-on-year Number of employees suspected of having TB 391 424 168 (7.7) Number of employees tested who were infected with TB 59 37 22 59.5 The TB prevalence number is expressed per 100 000 and not as a percentage. Government reports the national prevalence rate as 998/100 000. TB prevalence at RBPlat increased by 41% in 2013, due to more effective screening and investigation methods. 2013 2012 2011 TB prevalence 713/100 000 507/100 000 580/100 000 Silicosis Silicosis, a deadly lung disease, is one of the While miners working in the platinum mines oldest mining occupational diseases in the found in the North West province of South world.

Poverty alleviation and job creation Commercial community garden in Chaneng Village This award winning project was adopted by BRPM in September 2011. We equipped the garden with pumps, water tanks, Ongoing support shade netting structures, an irrigation system, a storeroom, wash bays and an ablution block and this year we purchased a since 2011 delivery vehicle. Establishing an enterprise development hub The hub is designed to be a Real Enterprise Development initiative, which will harness the entrepreneurial drive of unemployed First phase completed and self-employed South Africans. The concept is supported by international research revealing the power of the small business in 2013 – final phase sector to reduce unemployment. We originally intended completing the project in 2013, but it has now been split into three to be completed phases. The first phase, which was completed in 2013, included fencing the site with electrical fencing, 85% of the electrical in 2015 work has been done, the sewerage system is complete, the vegetable tunnels have been constructed and the preparation work for the foundations of the broilers has been done and the water reticulation system has been designed. Commercial agri business (hatchery, cattle and crop farming) This project will feed into the enterprise development hub. During 2013 we completed a headstock count of the livestock First phase completed in the MACHARORA villages (1 700), tagged them, dressed the udders of the cows to eliminate ticks, inoculated the in 2013 – ongoing animals twice, dipped them and put them on an electronic database which includes the gender of the animal and who its owner is. We are busy with a feasibility study on how best to implement the programme in 2014. This project has highlighted the excessive number of cattle versus the availability of grazing, which is of concern. Household vegetable gardens We have equipped 75 households in the MACHARORA villages with 2 x 5 000 litre JoJo tanks, 1 x 6 x 4 metre tunnels, 2013 roof gutters, a hand pump, sloped the land and provided training in growing vegetables for the household’s consumption and to sell to neighbouring homes and other potential markets. Education support Additional maths and science teachers and upgrading of maths and science classrooms We have funded the salaries of two additional maths teachers and one science teacher at Charora High School and a Ongoing projects facilitation coordinator has been appointed to look after the governance and help facilitate the roll-out of educational interventions in schools in the MACHARORA villages. The maths classroom at Charora High School was renovated, which included painting, tiling and the installation of new cupboards and white boards. We identified through the RBI that the chemicals in the science laboratory had expired and the equipment was out of Started in 2013 – date. This has been removed and having established what chemicals and equipment are required for the Grade 12 syllabus ongoing these have been supplied. A laptop has been purchased for use with an overhead projector. The aim of this project is to give pupils the opportunity to develop the maths and science skills they need for employment in the mining industry. Grade R classrooms We constructed two Grade R classrooms at Chaneng Primary School, equipped them and built surrounding walls. 2013 Community skills development Styldrift I requires different skills to accommodate its mechanised mining methods.

Our final product is a concentrate which is sold to a single customer, Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited (RPM), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American Platinum, through a concentrate offtake agreement. The concentrate must meet certain specifications in terms of the offtake agreement in relation to the PGM moisture and chrome content for each tonne of concentrate. These product specifications are assessed through specific and proven procedures agreed to by RBPlat and RPM. Our metals The platinum group metals (PGMs) – platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium and iridium – occur together in nature alongside gold, nickel, copper, cobalt and chrome. Many of the unique properties of PGMs make them indispensable to modern technology and 101 industry and their markets are many and Product stewardship believe that meeting our product varied, from the automotive industry to the stewardship commitment is best done in We systematically address the safety, health medical field.

RBPlat’s 67% interest mineral portfolio underlies the properties of Boschkoppie 104 JQ, Styldrift 90 JQ and portions of Frischgewaagd 96 JQ. The 2013 geological resource models were discounted by updated geological losses and depletion from BRPM. Due to limited exploration drilling in 2012 no sampling intersections were added to the mineral resource models. Therefore, the mineral resource classification 2013 – 2012 is unchanged. The Merensky reef tonnage consists of 45% measured, 35% indicated and 20% inferred mineral resources and the UG2 reef tonnage consists of 38% measured, 40% indicated and 22% inferred mineral resources compliant with SAMREC. Figure 1: RBPlat 2013 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves classification of the Merensky and UG2 reefs Inclusive mineral resources Inferred 10.27Moz Indicated 17.91Moz Measured 20.02Moz Mineral reserves Probable 3.04Moz Proven 7.60Moz Geological setting RBPlat’s mining operations and projects are located directly south of the Pilanesberg Igneous Complex, in the Western Limb of the Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC), in the stratigraphic sequence referred to as the Rustenburg Layered Suite. The Rustenburg Layered Suite hosts several commodities which include the PGMs and chromitite. The mineable economic horizons include the platiniferous chromitite layers of the Upper Group number two seam (UG2 reef) and the Merensky reef, which are layered within the Critical Zone of the Rustenburg Layered Suite of the BIC. Mineral rights The status of mineral rights is indicated in Table 1. Sixty seven percent of all mineral rights on the specified farms and portions as tabled below are attributed to RBPlat and 33% to Rustenburg Platinum Mines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American Platinum, as per the BRPM Joint Venture agreement. 103 Table 1: RBPlat’s Mineral Rights status Properties Percentage interest Status Boschkoppie 104 JQ 67% New Order Mining Right Styldrift 90 JQ 67% New Order Mining Right Frischgewaagd 96 JQ Ptns 10, 14 67% New Order Prospecting Right Frischgewaagd 96 JQ Ptn. 17 67% New Order Prospecting Right Mineral resource management Mineral resources Salient points regarding resources > Mineral resources are reported as in-situ tonnes and grade and allow for geological losses > Mineral resources for 2013 are estimated at a minimum cut of 0.90m > All mineral resources and reserves stated in this chapter are reported as the 67% attributable interest of RBPlat > No mineral resources are excluded from the 2013 declaration relative to 2012 as a result of the cut-off grade calculation derived from the mineral reserve pay limits > For UG2 a 30 centimetre geotechnical support beam has been applied > Rounding of figures may result in computational discrepancies. Mineral resources summary Due to limited exploration drilling during 2012 as a result of capital budget deferment, the Merensky and UG2 resource estimates have not been updated with new drillhole data in 2013. Effectively, geological loss updates from structural models, internal boundary changes and depletion on the BRPM North and South shafts have been the changes since last year.

During 2013 supply chain management reviewed and refined all the strategic contracts which it took over last year and has been able to reduce costs 113 To support our Towards operational excellence strategy it is critical that we put in place effective and efficient structures. Our redesign of our organisational structures was guided by the following principles: > Any shared services function we establish will be integrated into the various functions, which will avoid a silo approach > There will not be a Head of shared services, instead reporting lines will be within the existing structures at either our operations or corporate office, giving us a fit for purpose hybrid model for shared services > Heads of department, general managers and Executive Committee members were extensively involved in the design of the organisational structures, including the extent of what would become shared services. Some functions, such as supply chain management, are already functioning as a shared service. The rest of the structure will be rolled out in 2014. Systems projects Having taken over the management of our ICT systems and conducted a review of them in 2013 we are busy optimising them. We need to make sure that our data is accurate and credible. We appointed a Chief Information Officer in 2013 who is driving the optimisation of our ICT systems. In 2014 our focus will be on changing our reporting from the nature of account principle to base it on accountability. This change means our people will be better empowered to take ownership of their part of the business and will have the information they need to better manage their costs. We will also have a particular focus on ensuring that throughout RBPlat, from our CEO to operational level, our people are provided with appropriate and relevant reporting in real time so they have information available that they need to make informed business decisions. Our innovation and excellent project implementation recognised RBPlat, competing with companies across Africa, was a Gold winner of a SAP Quality Award for excelling in the planning and execution of a SAP software implementation in the medium implementation category. The project for which we won this award was the transitioning of our SAP and peripheral systems portfolio in 2012. This achievement now puts us up against winners from the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions in the next stage of the competition. The judges complimented the RBPlat team on its thorough and detailed understanding of the scope of the project, the commitment of key stakeholders, super users and sponsors to achieving the goals and deadlines and the fact that the project came in on time and on budget. They also recognised that the implementation was well aligned with our business requirements and that we had a comprehensive understanding of the risks and properly mitigated these risks through technical and user testing and proactive efforts to reduce the complexity of the risks. The judges also recognised our innovative use of the SAP Landscape Transformation tool for the first time in Africa. Project management Capital projects Organic growth is a key pillar of our strategy and the future sustainability of RBPlat depends skills on our ability to achieve this growth. Our project team, which was formed in 2009, is responsible for the successful delivery of our projects and has a key role to play in achieving this strategy. The right level of owner involvement is the key to project success. We identified a team with appropriate management, technical and supervisory skills at all levels of project organisation and all with the ability to work as integrated members of the team with a common goal. Our definition of a successful project is one that is delivered on time, within budget and according to plan. 114 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Annual Report 2013 115 TRANSPARENCY 7 AND ACCOUNTABILITY 116 Chairman’s corporate governance review 117 Corporate governance 126 Social and Ethics Committee report 127 Ethics and human rights 128 Risk management 134 Remuneration and performance 139 Independent assurance report 116 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Annual Report 2013 Transparency and accountability Chairman’s corporate governance review Adv Kgomotso Moroka Chairman At RBPlat we recognise the leadership role By appointing strong independent directors of the Board in taking responsibility for the we benefit from their expertise and good governance of the Group on behalf of perspective and the introduction of different our stakeholders.

In the A-weighted system, the decibel values of sounds at low frequencies are reduced, compared with unweighted decibels, in which no correction is made for audio frequency. This correction is made because the human ear is less sensitive at low audio frequencies, especially below 1 000 Hz, than at high audio frequencies Decline A generic term used to describe a shaft at an inclination below the horizontal and usually at the same angle as the dip of the reef DMR Department of Mineral Resources DWA Department of Water Affairs EBITDA Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation Employees who tested HIV The number of employees that have been identified as HIV positive as indicated by the test results in the positive reporting period.
