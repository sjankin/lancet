Introduction Altron is pleased to present its 2014 United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Communication on Progress (COP) report, covering the group’s activities for the period 31 October 2013 to 31 October 2014. Altron has been a signatory to the UNGC since 2009, and has been an active participant in various meetings and related initiatives in line with the UNGC principles, in particular through the National Business Initiative (NBI), a local business association that supports and encourages implementation of among others the UNGC’s 10 principles and the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in South Arica. This document represents our fifth COP report (2010-2014) and as the different commitments, initiatives and projects outlined in this report shows, we continue to support and integrate the 10 principles into our strategy, our culture and our day-to-day operations, demonstrating our continued commitment and support towards the UNGC. Through our commitment to the UNGC we emphasise our efforts to embrace, support and enact a set of core values in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment as well as our efforts to combat corruption. We believe that the 2014 COP report not only highlights the importance we place on the 10 principles but also assists stakeholders to cross reference each of the principles to the various initiatives we have implemented and the progress made to date. As a publicly listed company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in South Africa, Altron accepts its responsibility to ensure that the company operate in a manner that not only strives to be financially sound, but also encourages a high level of transparency, accountability and social and environmentally responsible behaviour. To achieve this, we ensure that our governance and risk management structures identify, and where applicable, adhere to local and international standards and best practices, including the UNGC. In addition to being signatories to the UNGC, Altron actively takes part in the following local and international initiatives and codes of good practise:  Carbon Disclosure Program (CDP) – since 2008 (ongoing);  Carbon Disclosure Program Water (CDP W) – voluntary submission since 2011 (ongoing);  JSE Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Index – since 2004 (ongoing);  Adherence to the recommendations of the King Code of Corporate Governance for South Africa (King III) – since 2010 (ongoing); and  United Nations Millennium Development Goals as part of the UNGC COP report – since 2009 (ongoing). ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 Page |3 2. Statement of Continued Support Allied Electronics Corporation Limited (Altron) continues to support the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact in respect of human rights, labour rights, environmental protection and anti-corruption As Chief Executive of Altron, I welcome the opportunity to again reaffirm our commitment to advancing the UNGC principles not only through our direct business activities, but also within our sphere of influence. We aim to lead by example in the area of responsible business conduct by raising awareness of the importance of the UNGC principles. Respecting these principles today will ensure a better future for our company and our stakeholders tomorrow. Having formally launched our sustainability strategy in 2013, we know and understand that our business success is directly linked to the integration of environmental, social, and governance issues into our longterm business strategy as well as our day-to-day operations. The Altron group continues to strive for the highest possible standards in good corporate citizenship and sustainable business practices. As such, integrity and commitment to our stakeholders have been one of our primary focuses over the years. In all of our business dealings, honesty, fairness, equality, and ethical conduct form the cornerstone of how we conduct business.” R.E. Venter Chief Executive Altron 3. Communication on Progress in Meeting the Expectation of the 10 UNGC Principles The UNGC is a call to all companies to voluntarily align their operations and strategies with the 10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and to take action in support of UNGC goals and issues related thereto. The UNGC is a leadership platform for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible corporate policies and practices. This year marks the fifth year of Altron’s commitment to the UNGC and its 10 guiding principles. While much has changed in the world and within our company since our first COP report in 2009/2010, our commitment to the compact’s 10 principles remains firm. We recognise that we have a duty of responsibility that extends to our shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, business partners, government and the communities in which we operate. Our commitment to the Global Compact – as well as our commitment to working responsibly – is a fundamental part of how we fulfil our company’s vision. The principles are embedded within our company’s business practices, policies, and operations and help us perform and operate in a responsible manner. The landscape of business is changing. Governments, citizens and customers are increasingly calling on companies to account for the way in which they do business – they expect businesses to behave responsibly and transparently, and to ensure that their impacts do not cause harm to people or the planet. What this means is that business can no longer chase profits at the expense of everything else. A company that makes money while harming the environment, employing child labour, disrespecting the rights of its employees or selling harmful products, will no longer be tolerated and cannot survive or thrive. In other words, it will not be sustainable in the long term. Sustainability is not a new concept to Altron – it is something that we have been doing for a long time in various ways. While we have always focused on ensuring that the business is well-run, profitable and able to adapt to changing market conditions, our sustainability journey first began in the late 1990s when ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 Page |4 we turned our attention to diversity and the issue of black economic empowerment. This was followed by a strong focus on corporate social investment and later, an effort to understand and reduce our environmental impacts. In the mid-2000s we produced our first dedicated Sustainability Report and at the end of the decade Altron was one of the first companies in South Africa to make the transition to integrated reporting which brings sustainable business practices into the core of our business. This evolution has paved the way for where we find ourselves today – a company with a fully-fledged sustainability strategy which cuts across all aspects of business and drives the fundamental business strategy of our organisation. Sustainability is no longer a part of our business – it is our business. It has become part of our DNA. 4. Summary of progress toward meeting the expectation of the 10 UNGC Principles The UNGC has presented practical guidelines to Altron in its journey to integrate sustainability into our business strategy. In 2012 Altron developed its first formal sustainability strategy which was launched in January 2013, followed by the development of a sustainability manual that supports the implementation and rollout of the sustainability strategy in the group. Altron annually updates the manual to ensure the company stays abreast with the latest national and international developments and also update their own strategy to be in line with any new development and/or requirements. In addition, Altron’s Social and Ethics Committee, which was appointed by the Altron shareholders and came into effect on 1 March 2012, monitors and oversees those social and ethical functions as set out in the Companies Act as well as those responsibilities assigned to it by the Board. These responsibilities include but are not limited to Altron’s performance with respect to legislation and codes of best practice, labour, human rights, and the environment. With this COP, we confirm that we are actively working towards ensuring that the UNGC and its principles become fully entrenched in our business strategy and culture, and that we will continue to seek and participate in collaborative projects that advance the broader development goals of the UNGC and the MDGs. The aim of the 2014 COP report is to detail the ongoing commitments, actions and progress Altron has made against the 10 principles. The report provides an abridged and partial view into how we acknowledge and implement the 10 principles in our business. The report should be read in conjunction with the groups 2013 Integrated Annual Report, which can be found at www.altron.com . ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 Page |5 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Policies, procedures and management structures Altron remains committed to upholding fundamental human rights in the workplace and throughout our sphere of influence. In general, human rights are well managed throughout the group. As a signatory to the UNGC, Altron has made a public commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This commitment is encapsulated in the company’s Code of Ethics and its Human Rights and Labour Conditions Policy that can be found on our website at www.altron.com Altron has a comprehensive set of policies, procedures and committees to ensure the protection of human rights, where the protection of rights permeates through a number of employee, subsidiary and/or supplier codes and/or agreements. We review these policies annually to ensure that we adequately address issues such as forced and/or compulsory labour, child labour, discrimination and gender equity. Implementation and initiatives The Altron Social and Ethics Committee, which is a statutory committee in terms of the Companies Act of SA, assists the group with the oversight of social and ethical matters relating to the Altron group and performs an oversight and monitoring role in terms of any relevant human rights abuses associated with our group, our suppliers and our partners. Altron acknowledges that our ‘sphere of influence’ extends beyond our employees and shareholders. We embraces a cradle-to-grave approach to corporate responsibility and as such extended our human rights focus to include our own suppliers and contractors. In the past Altron conducted surveys with a range of international suppliers from different countries and industries to assess their practices relating to basic human rights including health and safety; hours, wages and leave; fair treatment of employees; community impacts; product stewardship, labour practices; the risk profile of the country concerned; and the extent to which suppliers’ manage and monitor human rights in their own supply chain. Although this was a once-off exercise we continue to engage with and educate suppliers on issues of sustainability, ensuring that they are familiar with our expectations as outlined in our group’s policies and procedures. In the last reporting period Altron formalised its “Sustainability in the Supply chain Strategy” and is currently looking at engaging with our major suppliers around our four sustainable business value drivers of which human capital is one. Phase one of the strategy included the identification and evaluation of our most strategic and key suppliers. Phase two of the study will commence at the end of their year. This includes a detailed questionnaire that enquires about issues such as human capital, human rights, environmental, corruption and responsible products and services. In addition, Altron will require all key suppliers to confirm that they have read and understood and agree to the relevant Altron policies and procedures and that they subscribe to principles of lawful and ethical business conduct as dealt with in these policies. Continued stakeholders engagement is a material focus for the group. Altron’s Sustainability Department engages with a wide range of stakeholders including employees, suppliers, customers and contractors on key topics such as human rights, ethics and the company’s sustainability strategy. A detailed discussion of our stakeholder engagement is available on our group’s website at www.altron.com. To date no human rights issues were brought to our attention or identified as part of our stakeholder engagement process. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 Page |6 While certain countries in which Altron operates, have been identified as posing a potential risk to human rights, none of our operations reported or were implicated in any incidents of discrimination, violation of human rights or the rights of indigenous peoples, nor were there any grievances relating to human rights abuses, in the year under review. Feedback and Goals The following provides a summary of achievements and future human rights commitments: Achievements  Finalised the Altron “Sustainability in the Supply Chain Strategy”;  Conducted Phase one of the strategy – identification and evaluation of key suppliers;  Monitored human rights through our Social and Ethics Committee;  Chief Ethics Officer continued to monitor any human rights abuses; and  Reviewed and where applicable updated the following policies and procedures:  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Code of Conduct  Code of Ethics Commitments  Implement phase two of the ”Sustainability in the Supply Chain Strategy” and include human rights as one of the issues to review;  Continue to engage with all stakeholders to promote human rights;  Continue to roll out the ethics training to all employees;  Identify any human rights issues via the group’s Social and Ethics Committee; and  Annually compile articles for internal and external use, reconfirming our commitment to promote and prevent human right abuse.

Labour Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Policies, procedures and management structures As expressed in our “Human Rights and Labour Conditions Policy”, Altron actively recognises the right of employees to collective bargaining and freedom of association in accordance with all relevant labour legislation. Altron is also committed to facilitating open communication and direct engagement between employees and management in those situations where the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining is restricted under law. Organised labour unions are an important stakeholder in many of our businesses, and large numbers of employees belong to various unions across the group, particularly in our manufacturing operations. The number of unionised employees remained relatively similar year-on-year with a marginal increase from 24% in 2013 to 24.03% in 2014. This is despite the rationalisation exercises undertaken in many Powertech businesses. The majority of unionised workers are employed at Powertech (63,62% of Powertech’s workforce), while only 7,2% and 0.84% of Altech and Bytes employees respectively belong to unions that are recognised in collective bargaining agreements. The proportion of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements at Bytes is small and does not meet the minimum requirements for a formal constitution body. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 Page |7 In addition to union representation, employee rights are protected through the full compliance of all Altron companies with relevant local legislation, including the Labour Relations Act (1995), the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (1997), the Employment Equity Act 55 (1998), the Skills Development Act (1998), the Occupational Health and Safety Act (1993), the Unemployment Insurance Act (1993) and the BroadBased Black Economic Empowerment Act (2003). We are also governed by the Bill of Rights as contained in the South African constitution, the United Nations Global Compact on Human Rights and our own internal Human Rights Policy, all of which cover various aspects of the rights of employees. Implementation and initiatives Wherever employees are represented by unions or through collective bargaining units, Altron maintains constructive relationships with all of our unions, who are afforded consultative and/or negotiating powers on issues of shared interest. Copies of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the Skills Development Act and the Employment Equity Act are displayed in all work places and made available on the company’s intranet. Formal grievance procedures are also in place through which employees can raise issues. Through its Social and Ethics Committee Altron continues to monitor and provide feedback on any issues related to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Feedback and Goals During the year under review, none of Altron’s operations have specifically been identified as posing a risk for undermining the rights of employees to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining. All employees have the freedom to belong to recognised bargaining councils as per the Labour Relations Act of South Africa. The following provides a summary of achievements and future commitments on freedom of association and collective bargaining: Achievements  Engaged with employees via unions and collective bargaining units;  Included unions and collective bargaining units in relevant meetings and committees;  Continued to monitor and review issues related to freedom of association and collective bargaining;  Identified and addressed areas of concern as raised by unions throughout the period under review;  Conducted workplace risk assessments; and  Reviewed and where applicable updated the following policies and procedures:  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Industrial Relations Policy  Code of Conduct Targets  Continue to uphold and implement the actions listed above GRI Indicators LA4, LA5; HR1 HR3, HR5, SO5 UN MGD Refer to initiatives supporting the UN MDG on pages 20-28 of this report. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 Page |8 Labour Principle 4: Elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5: Effective abolition of child labour Policies, procedures and management structures As indicated in our ‘Human Rights and Labour Conditions Policy”, Altron does not permit any form of forced, compulsory or child labour be it within any of our own companies, or within our extensive supply chain. All employees, including contractors, are sourced from the open labour market, with all employment occurring in the presence of mutually agreed upon labour contracts in accordance with relevant labour legislation. All employees are afforded the freedom to resign at any time. Altron actively monitors compliance with the labour legislation in each of the countries within which we operate, and are mindful of the variances in minimum age restrictions. Implementation and initiatives Altron supports the promotion of equality and prevention of unfair discrimination within the work environment. Its group-wide transformation strategy “Beyond 2012” was launched in July 2012. This strategy strives to address, among others, employment equity targets for senior management and higher levels within the group. Similar to overseeing human rights in the group, Altron’s Social and Ethics Committee, is also responsible for monitoring social and ethical matters relating to forced and compulsory labour and/or child labour. As previously mentioned in principal one, Altron’s “Sustainability in the Supply Chain Strategy” will include human rights issues such as forced, compulsory and child labour issues. As part of this engagement we aim to identify any human rights violations and incidents in our supply chain with the view to guide and if necessary assist these suppliers in addressing their human rights issues. While certain countries in which Altron operates have been identified as posing a potential risk to human rights, none of our operations has specifically been identified as posing a risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labour, child labour or for undermining the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining. To our knowledge there were no grievances filed relating to any of Altron’s operations, their partners or suppliers with regards to any form of human rights abuse including forced and compulsory labour or child labour during the year under review. Feedback and Goals The following provides a summary of achievements and future commitments on forced and compulsory labour as well as child labour issues: Achievements  Continue to include our “Human Rights and Labour Conditions Policy” to suppliers as part of their appointment contract;  Continue to monitor the press for any indication of human rights issues identified with any of our suppliers and/or clients;  Improved awareness among employees on their rights around forced and compulsory labour;  Ide; and  Reviewed and where applicable updated the following policies and procedures:  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Human Resources and Employment Policy  Code of Conduct ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 Page |9 Commitments  Continue to uphold and implement the actions listed above;  Include labour issues in our “Sustainability in the Supply Chain Strategy”; and  Continue to monitor and manage any labour related issues internally in the group and in our supply chain. GRI Indicators HR1 HR3, HR7, HR10, HR11, SO5 UN MGD Refer to initiatives supporting the UN MDG on pages 20-28 of this report. Labour Principle 6: Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Policies, procedures and management structures Altron adheres to this principle through a combination of policies, procedures and committees ensuring the protection of employee rights. Altron supports the promotion of equality and prevention of unfair discrimination within the work environment. Its group-wide transformation strategy, “Beyond 2012”, was launched during 2012 and strives to address, among others, employment equity targets. The Altron Code of Ethics clearly lays out aspirational ethical guidelines for everyday behaviour to codify the conduct required by managers, employees and owners in their dealings with one another, customers, suppliers and society at large. Altron requires all its representatives to act in good faith and in a manner that promotes our aspiration to be a good corporate citizen. The issue of corporate ethics receives attention from the highest level of management within Altron, with the chief executive being ultimately responsible for implementing our Code of Ethics and Corporate Code of Conduct. We also require all of our suppliers to acknowledge and confirm in all supplier contracts that they have read and understood our Code of Ethics and agree to be guided by it in terms of their actions and behaviour towards their own employees. Implementation and initiatives The Board, Audit, Human Capital Council and Social and Ethics Committees monitor compliance with Altron’s Codes of Ethics through feedback from the whistle-blower hotline (Tip-off Tim), the ethics office, Altron’s Internal Audit Department and the relevant sub-holding group security officers. Our Social and Ethics Committee is the vehicle for the Altron directors to initiate various programmes and receive feedback on any unethical behaviour and discrimination in the workplace. Results of these programmes are reported to the Social and Ethics Committee which filter through to the Risk Management Committee, the Audit Committee and ultimately the Board. The Social and Ethics Committee also assists the Board with the review of social and ethical matters relating to the Altron group, its employees, partners and supply chain. It performs an oversight and monitoring role in terms of:  the embedding of a culture of ethical behaviour in Altron in partnership with the Altron ethics office, which is run by the chief ethics officer, and the internal audit function;  activities with regard to any relevant legislation or codes of best practice;  activities with regard to social and economic development;  good corporate citizenship;  performance in terms of the environment, health and public safety, including the impact of the company’s activities on its employees; and ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 P a g e | 10  promotion of equality, prevention of unfair discrimination, reduction of corruption, transformation policies and strategies and social responsibility policies and strategies. Altron recognises that transformation and elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, is an on-going process, not an end-point, and with this in mind the company has formulated a new “Beyond 2012” transformation strategy to drive the next phase of transformation. Altron’s Transformation Committee (Transcom) plays an integral part in the company’s transformation success. Reporting to the Altron Executive Committee, Transcom drives the company’s transformation strategy and is guided in this by South Africa’s broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) legislation, which includes the Skills Development Act and Employment Equity Act, and the Department of Trade and Industry’s Codes of Good Practice (dti CoGP). As per South African legislation, Altron submits to government an annual Employment Equity Report, and includes all relevant statistics within our Integrated Annual Report. Altron is committed to prevent discrimination in respect of employment and to promote employment equity in the workplace. To his end Altron continues to improve overall awareness around discrimination and where relevant review and update policies that deal with discrimination and harassment. The following policies and procedures are available from the Human Resource Departments of the Altron group and can also be accessed on the Altron Intranet:  Human Resources and Employment Policy  Sexual Harassment Policy  HIV and AIDS Policy  Disciplinary Code and Procedures  Grievance Procedures  Succession Planning Procedure  Code of Conduct  Corporate Compliance Policy  Code of Ethics  Anti-corruption and Economic Crime Policy  Safety Health and Environmental Policy  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Whistle-Blowing Guidelines Policy In 2014/5 Altron is planning to place a renewed focus on HIV/AIDS in the workplace and if possible extend awareness of the disease to our employees’ families and communities. Feedback and Goals The following provides a summary of achievements and future commitments to monitor and control any discrimination in respect of employment and occupation: Achievements  Continue to implement “Beyond Vision 2012” transformation strategy;  Maintained our Ethics Office through the appointed Chief Ethics Officer;  Continued to report any discrimination to the Social and Ethics Committee;  Continued to conducted ethics climate surveys across our operations;  Various articles published in our internal magazines to prevent any form of discrimination; and  Reviewed and where applicable updated the following policies and procedures:  Human Resources and Employment Policy  Sexual Harassment Policy  HIV and AIDS Policy  Disciplinary Code and Procedures  Grievance Procedures ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 P a g e | 11  Succession Planning Procedure  Code of Conduct  Corporate Compliance Policy  Code of Ethics  Anti-corruption and Economic Crime Policy  Safety Health and Environmental Policy  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Whistle-Blowing Guidelines Policy Commitments  Continue to uphold and implement the actions listed above;  Implement specific targets are part of our “Beyond Vision 2012” transformation strategy; and  Identify relevant action plans to improve the overall awareness and effectiveness of the group’s HIV/AIDS awareness campaign amongst staff with specified focus on our manufacturing operations.

Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Policies, procedures and management structures There is a clear business case for sound environmental management in Altron. It reduces our exposure to a range of risks including financial risks arising from taxes and fines, reputational brand risks, supply chain management and business interruption risks that could arise from changes in weather patterns or extreme weather conditions associated with climate change. In response to the imminent threats posed by climate change and increased pollution, Altron has, over the last few years, increased its understanding of environmental issues, and made a strong commitment to reduce its environment footprint. We focus on lowering our carbon and water footprint, improving energy efficiencies, reducing pollution, reducing waste to landfill and ensuring the responsible use of water. While most of our operations, with the exception of Powertech, operate in industries with a low environmental footprint, we remain committed to lowering our environmental impact as part of our journey towards a sustainable business strategy. Environmental management is closely aligned to some of our business goals and has the potential to positively impact on our bottom line. Recycling and more efficient use of water and electricity, reduces overhead costs at a time when the entire group is focused on cost reduction initiatives. Implementation and initiatives The precautionary approach to identifying and managing environmental risk is at the heart of Altron’s environmental policies, procedures and newly formulated sustainable business strategy. Altron’s first formal sustainability strategy was launched in January 2013 and was followed shortly by the release of a sustainability manual that provided more detail as to how the strategy was developed, the implications and practical implementation of the strategy. Altron has subsequently reviewed and updated the sustainability manual to ensure that amongst other new environmental developments and commitments are included in the manual. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 P a g e | 12 Altron continue to produce an annual sustainability report, in the form of our Integrated Annual Report, and is predominantly based on Altron’s understanding of ever-increasing stakeholder expectations for effective environmental management and continued environmental awareness requirements. During the year Altron reaffirmed its commitment to reduce its environmental footprint, guided by our environmental management processes and our three year reduction targets for water, waste and carbon emissions. These environmental risks are managed and monitored by the group and remains a standing item on all Risk Management and Social and Ethics Committee meeting agendas. Both these committees comprise the chief executives (‘CE’) and senior executives from the various sub-holding companies, as well as non-executive directors and various group managers. We have appointed key individuals at board level to represent and provide feedback on the group’s sustainability agenda. Altron’s committed to environmental management has been a key performance indicator directly linked to the award of bonuses to executive management since 2010 (carbon emissions only). In 2012/2013, the commitment has been increased in that management’s performance bonuses are now directly linked to Altron’s three year environmental reduction targets for waste, water and carbon emissions. External environmental consultants continue to conduct internal compliance audits on water, waste and energy at relevant sites in our operations. These audits did not identify any significant issues during the year and there were no significant environmental incidents or spills. We were not subject to any fines for non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations. In January 2014 Altron appointed, for the first time, an internal environmental auditor that will be responsible for conducting internal water, waste, energy and sustainability audits in the group. This internal audit process will commence in 2015 after a detailed audit plan has been approved by the group. In 2014 Altron hosted its fourth annual sustainability workshop. The workshop was attended by more than 85 employees ranging from Altron’s Chief Executive to strategic consultants in the group. This year’s theme was “Crystallising our Sustainable Growth”. This annual workshop provides a great platform to share ideas, introduced new targets and initiatives and for company employees to network around the theme of sustainability. Altron continues to identify the “greenest company” in the group, as part of its annual awards event. In 2014 we had a record amount of companies entering this category. This is just another indication that environmental issues are becoming more and more prominent and important in the group. Altron also identified the impact waste has on the environment and the company’s bottom line. In an attempt to reduce waste to landfill and improve the bottom line, the group appointed waste consultants to conduct a formal waste management assessment in 2014. The findings of the assessment is currently being used to develop a formal waste management strategy and to set new three year waste reduction targets for the group. Not only is Altron committed to continuous improvement in our environmental performance, as reported in our Integrated Annual Report, but our attempts to educate our employees, customers and suppliers, through our internal magazine, screensavers, workshops, competitions and awareness campaigns, further demonstrates how we intend to use the knowledge we gain at the operational level to inform positive change throughout our sphere of influence. With so many initiatives and projects currently being implemented, Altron has identified the need to develop a formal Environmental Management Strategy that will include all the above mentioned initiatives and strategies for the group. The environmental strategy should be completed and ready for implementation in 2015. Part of this strategy includes the review and updating of our environmental policy and operational procedures. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 P a g e | 13 Feedback and Goals The following provides a summary of achievements and future commitments to monitor and control environmental challenges and to improve general awareness: Achievements  Reviewed and updated the group’s sustainability strategy that is aligned with the company’s four core strategic objectives;  Summited our fifth CDP submission;  Took part in our third voluntary Water CDP submission;  Conducted our fourth internal “sustainability workshop”;  Appointed our first internal environmental auditor;  Conducted a formal waste assessment audit;  Conducted various internal environmental audits;  Continued to conduct internal environmental legal compliance audits;  Reviewed and updated our SHE Policy; and  Reviewed and updated our Climate Change Framework.

The group continues to focus on delivering the best quality products and services without harming the environment. To this end we adhere to applicable legislation, policies and procedures as well as relevant standards and frameworks including but not limited to ISO14001, ISO9001 and OSHAS18001. Some of the Altron’s Operations are also looking at implementing the ISO 50001 (energy management system) and ISO 26000 (social responsibility) standards in the next two years. Although not applicable across all product and/or service lines, the development and diffusion of environmentally-friendly technologies is often at the forefront of our future-minded thinking. The increased global focus on environmental responsibility and the ever increasing pressure from our stakeholders opens up new business opportunities for the group each year. With the cost of electricity rapidly rising, and water soon to follow, the decision to develop and/or adopt energy-and-water-wise solutions is most frequently based on our continuous push towards financial efficiency and waste minimisation. In addition to being an important part of our environmental responsibility, greater energy and water efficiencies are a social and business imperative. The most evident business case for environmental responsibility is that it reduces our exposure to a number of risks and should result in cost reductions throughout the group. Direct financial risks arise from the proposed South African carbon taxation legislation, the potential for fines relating to non-compliance with environmental legislation, damage to operations and business disruptions that could result from physical environmental disasters. In addition, responsible environmental management protects us from reputational risk and the risk of losing customers and industry partners, as a result of products and services produced and delivered in an environmentally unfriendly manner. Altron will continue to invest and support innovative products and services ideas through its innovation hubs and research and development budgets. Implementation and initiatives Environmental, health and safety reviews conducted throughout the group in the past year revealed that no SHE impacts relating to group’s activities, products and services have been reported on communities, employees and/or customers. Altron continues striving towards improving product stewardship and monitors potential risks associated with products and services in its supply chain, including the potential risk of a product recall. As part of our innovation and R&D initiatives, operations within the group continue to look at and investigate environmentally friendly technologies associated with our products and services.

Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Policies, procedures and management structures Altron subscribes to the highest standards of good governance and ethical business practice. Altron has a zero-tolerance approach towards those who engage in corruption, bribery, fraudulent or illegal acts in the conduct of its business. Altron’s compliance framework rests on the company’s comprehensive set of policies. These are regularly updated to reflect governance best practice and the evolving legal environment. All group companies and ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 P a g e | 16 employees are obliged to comply with these policies. Altron’s Corporate Compliance Policy focuses on 10 fundamental principles of business conduct, which includes the following:  No anti-competitive behaviour;  No corruption;  No inappropriate risks for human health and the environment;  No insider trading;  No deception;  No discrimination;  No infringement of others’ intellectual property rights;  No conflicts of interest;  No misinformation; and  No breach of laws. We are guided by the Altron Code of Ethics and Corporate Code of Conduct which commit all employees to the highest standards of behaviour. The Code of Conduct is included in the Altron group Policy Manual and outlines Altron’s philosophy on corruption. In addition, Altron’s Anti-corruption and Economic Crime Policy provides guidance on preventing and dealing with corruption, fraud and other illegal acts. This policy is closely aligned with the requirements of the UK Bribery Act the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and our own domestic legislation regarding bribery and corruption. Altron requires all its representatives to act in good faith and in a manner that promotes our aspiration to be a good corporate citizen. The issue of corporate ethics receives attention from the highest level of management within Altron, with the chief executive being ultimately responsible for implementing our Code of Ethics and Corporate Code of Conduct. We also require all of our suppliers to acknowledge and confirm in all supply contracts that they conclude with the group that they have read and understood our Code of Ethics and agree to be guided by it in terms of their actions and behaviour. As stated previously the Altron Board, Audit and Social and Ethics Committees monitor compliance with Altron’s Code of Ethics through feedback from the whistle-blower hotline (Tip-off Tim), the ethics office, Altron’s Internal Audit Department and the relevant sub-holding group security officers. Implementation and initiatives At Altron, anti-corruption and the promotion thereof falls within the ambit of the wider Altron ethics management programme. The Altron board confirmed its commitment to conducting business with the highest ethical standards including the values of integrity, accountability, transparency and respect, by signing an Altron board ethics statement and publishing same on the Altron intranet in late 2013. Altron’s group-wide ethics training project came to an end in 2013 with almost 100% of employees receiving training on Altron’s Code of Ethics. An overview of the project and recommendations for improvement were received and in 2014, a number of other initiatives were introduced to the group Altron’s legal department hosted a conference for employees in senior executive and top management positions for purposes of providing them with information and guidance on both local and international legislation applicable to the Altron group, which incorporate aspects of, inter alia, corruption and bribery. In order to consistently remind employees of the standard of conduct required by them in terms of proper, ethical and lawful conduct, the Altron group conducted its annual exercise where management and key employees were required to declare in writing that during the year, they complied with applicable policies, standard and requirements. The declaration of proper conduct was distributed to employees and approximately 773 responses were received with no reports of non-compliance. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 P a g e | 17 Altron’s Tip-Off Tim anonymous whistle-blowing hotline remains Altron’s main tool for reporting incidents of fraud, theft, corruption and other acts of illegal/dishonest behaviour. The hotline is outsourced to an independent third party and reports on various investigations in to allegations of such behaviour are monitored by Altron’s internal audit department. Reports by Altron’s internal audit department are submitted to Altron’s Social and Ethics Committee and Altron Risk Management Committee and ultimately get reported to Altron’s Board. Apart from Altron’s anonymous tip-off line, concerns around fraudulent or illegal activity can also be reported directly to:  a secure, confidential e-mail address at Altron’s ethics office;  Altron’s Internal Audit Department;  Altron’s Ethics Officer; and  the relevant sub-holding group security officers. No legal action was taken against the company for anti-competitive behaviour, anti-trust or monopoly practices and Altron was not subject to any fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and regulations during the past year. Altron was advised to improve the visibility of the group’s ethics management initiatives and a project to re-brand ethics at Altron, including Tip-Off Tim, namely, the Altron Ethics Dialogue, was therefore developed and introduced to the group in 2014. An ethics mascot as well as new communicative material was designed and the Altron’s intranet (Alix) was updated accordingly. (Alix remains the main communicative portal for the group). In addition thereto, Altron maintains its ethics e-learning facility for all employees to participate in and gain additional knowledge on ethical conduct. Altron’s internal audit department continues to regularly conduct ethics climate surveys and reports on the results thereof get submitted to Altron’s Social and Ethics Committee for deliberation. Operations identified as having weak ethical climates are referred to the ethics office so that remedial action can be implemented. Apart from the abovementioned initiatives, Altron continues to develop its initiatives to counteract the risks associated with bribery and corruption in the workplace. To date, these have included, among others, the following:  adoption of an Anti-corruption and Economic Crime Policy that deals with many of the issues contemplated in the UK Bribery Act and in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the USA;  adoption of a Corporate Compliance Policy;  adoption of a Gifts and Entertainment Policy as well as an electronics gifts register;  implementation of a Declaration of Interest Policy;  inclusion of a standard ethical conduct clause for incorporation in all supply and other customer contracts;  adoption of a Reportable Irregularities Policy;  amendment of Altron’s memorandum of incorporation to record that no donations may be made to political parties without obtaining the prior approval of shareholders;  implementation of a Whistle-blowing Guidelines Policy; and  the adoption and regular review of a group-wide Code of Ethics and Corporate Code of Conduct. During the year Altron became a signatory the UNGC’s Call to Action: Anti-Corruption and the Global Development Agenda, and Altron remains a signatory to the World Without Corruption, both, international initiatives to fight corruption (refer to Appendix A and B for more detail). ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2014 UNGC COP Report October 2014 P a g e | 18 Altron is also satisfied that no donations have been made to any political parties during the past year, which is in accordance with Altron’s memorandum of incorporation which states that all donations to political parties must be pre-approved by shareholders in a general meeting.
