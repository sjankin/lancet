Practically, a minimum of 10 years of cumulated seniority recognized by the plan is required to receive benefits under this plan, with a maximum of 15 years. The reference remuneration is the fixed remuneration (disregarding variable remuneration or any other additional compensation). Each year of seniority under this plan allows the acquisition of a percentage of rights equal to 4% of the sole fixed remuneration which is, in fact, 2% of the fixed remuneration plus the variable on-target remuneration for the Chairman and CEO. The reference to the fixed remuneration was preferred to the total compensation (fixed + variable) in order to prevent windfall effects and to allow a greater predictability of accrual amounts. In any event, the rules for calculating the rights acquired under this scheme will prevent the Chairman and CEO from receiving an annual pension of an amount exceeding 45% of his average annual compensation during the period of membership in this plan (actual fixed and variable remunerations) and will prevent the potentially acquired rights in respect of each year of membership in this scheme from exceeding 5% of his remuneration for the relevant year (actual fixed and variable remunerations). The implementation of the Pension Plan of the Executive Committee members for the benefit of the present Chairman and CEO was authorized by the Board of Directors on March 26, 2009, was approved by the General Assembly on May 26, 2009 under the 4th resolution, and confirmed by the Board of Directors on December 17, 2009. 2013 Registration Document 281 G Corporate governance and capital G.5 Resolutions G.5.3 Board of Directors report to the Ordinary General Meeting on the transaction on the shares of the Company Dear Shareholders, We hereby inform you that the following transactions have been made on the Company’s shares by the Company’s executive officers and Directors and senior managers during 2013: Number of shares Number of shares Purchase price/ Name purchased sold Date Sale price (in euros) Patrick Adiba 1,700 06/17/2013 20.64 1,700 06/17/2013 54.8528 1,700 06/17/2013 24.57 1,700 06/17/2013 54.8528 13,000 09/10/2013 54.14 13,000 09/10/2013 58 8,323 11/27/2013 20.64 6,954 11/27/2013 62.0024 8,323 11/27/2013 24.57 6,954 11/27/2013 62.0024 8,323 11/27/2013 29.49 6,953 11/27/2013 62.0023 12,023 11/28/2013 20.64 10,046 11/28/2013 62.06 12,023 11/28/2013 24.57 10,046 11/28/2013 62.06 12,023 11/28/2013 29.49 10,047 11/28/2013 62.06 Thierry Breton 1,550 06/10/2013 18,4 1,550 06/10/2013 55.4977 1,550 06/10/2013 26.4 1,550 06/10/2013 55.4977 1,550 06/10/2013 22 1,550 06/10/2013 55.4977 Charles Dehelly 1,550 05/27/2013 22 1,550 05/27/2013 55 1,550 05/27/2013 18.40 1,550 05/27/2013 55 1,550 05/27/2013 26.4 1,550 05/27/2013 55 32,559 11/26/2013 18.4 27,118 11/26/2013 62.259 32,559 11/26/2013 22 27,118 11/26/2013 62.2589 32,558 11/26/2013 26.4 27,117 11/26/2013 62.259 19,273 11/27/2013 18.4 16,077 11/27/2013 61.9315 19,273 11/27/2013 22 16,077 11/27/2013 61.9315 19,274 11/27/2013 26.4 16,078 11/27/2013 61.9316 282 2013 Registration Document Corporate governance and capital G.5 Resolutions G Number of shares Number of shares Purchase price/ Name purchased sold Date Sale price (in euros) Jean Fleming 30 07/31/2013 30 30 07/31/2013 56.08 76 07/31/2013 25 76 07/31/2013 56.08 485 07/31/2013 35 485 07/31/2013 56.08 220 08/16/2013 30 220 08/16/2013 58.5 30 08/16/2013 58.88 Lynn Sharp Paine 500 08/27/2013 75.3281 Michel-Alain Proch 33,334 10/28/2013 20.64 33,334 10/28/2013 59.5579 16,667 10/28/2013 24.57 16,667 10/28/2013 59.5579 19,999 11/27/2013 29.49 19,999 11/27/2013 61.8928 Financière Daunou 17 S.A.2 8,900,000 11/27/2013 61.25 1 The transaction was carried out on US OTC Market at the price of $ 75.328. 2 Transaction carried out off-market (through an accelerated book building) by Financière Daunou 17 SA, having a close personal link with Michel Paris and Lionel Zinsou-Derlin, Directors of the Company.
