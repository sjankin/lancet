Mr. Goto: Recently, companies have been called upon to step up stakeholder engagement*2 in their CSR activities. In the course of exploring a company’s long-term strategic direction, companies are expected to reflect the opinions of stakeholders in this process.

In doing so, the thinking and awareness of families and society at large will gradually change. For this reason, I believe that companies must steadfastly work to promote diversity from a long-term perspective. Astellas: Until now, we have formulated and implemented medium-term human resources management policies. As for long-term growth strategies, we have so far considered mainly research and development and business areas. Based on what the experts have talked about today, we are strongly aware that we must now consider our human resources portfolio strategy from a more long-term perspective.

(1) A coefficient of 0.330 kg-CO2/kWh is used to calculate results needed to evaluate progress against the Environmental Action Plan and make investment decisions and implement countermeasures to bridge the gap between results and targets. The figures shown in the table above represent the results calculated using this coefficient. (2) Greenhouse gas emissions (actual emissions) for each fiscal year presented in series are calculated using the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan (FEPC)’s actual end-use greenhouse gas emissions coefficient (hereinafter, “the electricity CO2 emissions coefficient”) for the previous fiscal year. The figures for the greenhouse gas emissions reductions shown below represent results calculated using this coefficient. (A coefficient of 0.487 kg-CO2/kWh was used in fiscal 2013.)

Although this was 13.0% (33 kilotons) lower than the base year level in fiscal 2005, it was 11 kilotons higher than the previous fiscal year. This increase mainly reflected the start of operation of new facilities at production facilities, which among other factors added about 8 kilotons. Another factor was an increase of about 2 kilotons from deterioration in the electricity CO2 emissions coefficient compared to the previous fiscal year. The difference between the coefficient used to evaluate progress against the Environmental Action Plan and the coefficient Photovoltaic panels installed at the Tsukuba Research Center used to calculate actual emissions was 0.157 kg-CO2/kWh. The difference between these coefficients accounted for more than 34 kilotons of greenhouse gas emissions.

As of the end April, 2014, over 10,000 companies and organizations in 145 countries have declared their agreement with the principles. 74 Astellas Pharma Inc. _ Annual Report 2014 Global Compact Japan Network and Astellas The Global Compact Japan Network (GC-JN) was launched as a local network in Japan in December 2003, to serve as a platform for implementing the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, which are related to four fields. The GC-JN is made up of 186 Japanese companies and organizations that have agreed with the philosophy of the United Nations Global Compact (as of April 2014). The organization plans and holds symposiums, workshops and study meetings based on the four fields and ten principles. It also conducts research and makes proposals on sustainable global development. As a member of the GC-JN, Astellas dispatches personnel to the organization, and uses its membership to promote CSR-based management by learning about social trends and leading examples from other companies, while participating in subcommittees and study groups and building networks that include companies in other sectors. At the fiscal 2013 GC-JN Symposium Participants took discussion and ideas on CSR activities to a deeper level by examining the theme of Review of Operations “CSR and Management for the Future.” © Global Compact Japan Network My Experience in the Global Compact Japan Network I have been working on assignment at the GC-JN since October 2012. Through meetings and close exchange of information with the United Nations Global Compact Headquarters in New York, and over 100 local networks, I have directly experienced the global trend in CSR and its dynamism. I have seen first-hand the front lines where a vigorous discussion on the common theme of CSR is taking place between people of different cultural and political backgrounds, and across different industries. Seeing the day-to-day progress of the CSR world has been a tremendous stimulation for me. In Japan, enthusiastic network members organize regular activities such as subcommittees and seminars across industry boundaries to share their initiatives and issues related to CSR activities between companies and organizations. They disseminate the results of these activities to the public in an effort to raise the level of one another’s CSR activities. These self-initiated initiatives are an extremely unique and valuable characteristic among Yoshimi Ohno the local networks throughout the world. The practice and promotion of CSR-based manOn assignment to GC-JN since agement is founded on the awareness of individual employees, and I recognize that I have October 2012 an important role in ensuring that the knowledge and experience that I am gaining from GC-JN is fully utilized in Astellas’ CSR activities.

For Astellas to develop sustainably as a R&D-oriented pharmaceutical company and meet the expectations of its stakeholders, particularly shareholders and patients, it is essential that resources be allocated for the development of a succession of innovative new drugs. In addition, steady efforts such as monitoring side effects also contribute to maintaining a stable supply of safe prescription drugs. Based on my experience in university medical research and as a clinician, I intend to offer input and opinions to help ensure that the Company’s decision-making is appropriate for a global pharmaceutical company. Naoki Aikawa, M.D., Ph.D. Outside Director As chair of the Nomination Committee and Compensation Committee, I work to ensure that appropriate processes are followed in selecting executives and determining compensation and that sound management is maintained. In addition, with globalization progressing rapidly not only in Europe and North America but in emerging and other countries as well, it is inevitable that the ratio of business outside of Japan will increase at Astellas in the future. It will therefore be necessary to adequately monitor the implementation of governance and compliance measures not only in Japan but overseas as well. I intend to fulfill my duties as an outside Director, with a particular focus on sound management, to help Astellas create a firm foundation for contributing wholeheartedly to the global community through new drug discovery. Yutaka Kase Outside Director Astellas’ business philosophy is to contribute toward improving the health of people around the world. To realize its philosophy and basic strategy through creation of innovative new drugs with leading-edge technologies, Astellas has instituted the Corporate Executive System to enable swift and precise management. The Board of Directors has held active discussion and debate that challenges the proposals from the business execution body and has overseen business execution from a broad range of perspectives including CSR management. The Board has also made determinations on the basic direction of various management matters. Based on my long experience as a legal professional, I will actively provide input and opinions with a strong focus on risk management in various issues. In doing so, my goal is to help to maximize the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. Hironobu Yasuda Outside Director As a research and development-oriented global pharmaceutical company, it is essential for Astellas to conduct both sustained and destructive innovation in order to realize its business philosophy, which is to contribute toward improving the health of people around the world through the provision of innovative and reliable pharmaceutical products. I intend to help Astellas to accelerate its efforts to create a corporate culture and environment that enable its employees to continue to generate innovation with a sense of urgency. To this end, I will leverage my knowledge as a “family doctor” (consultant for strengthening management teams), drawing on my experience of making diagnoses and prescriptions for human resources-related issues for management teams from over 200 companies every year to oversee and provide support for business execution. Etsuko Okajima Outside Director Astellas has an advanced corporate governance system, and the Board of Directors engages in active discussion and debate on agenda items from a variety of perspectives. I believe that fair, highly transparent decisions are made with an awareness of the raison d’être, mission and beliefs that comprise the Company’s business philosophy. While further deepening information exchange with the Accounting Auditors and Internal Auditing Department and coordination with internal Corporate Auditors, I intend to actively provide input and opinions, particularly in accounting and finance, which are my areas of specialty, and contribute to further enhancing the Company’s corporate governance system. Shigeru Nishiyama Outside Corporate Auditor In my view, governance at Astellas is characterized by a transparent decision-making process and timely and accurate information disclosure. What makes this possible is the integrity of the people who make up the organization—people with a commitment to always engaging in business activities with a strong sense of ethics. As an outside Corporate Auditor, I have the mission to protect the value of Astellas. I have been involved in a large number of companies as a business consultant, and I believe that providing a neutral and objective perspective—the perspective of common sense—can help in the monitoring of corporate activities, even when opinion may be divided internally.
