This raised the customer base the Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), the Geothermal to 2,330,962 as at June 2013 compared to 2,038,625 the previous Development Company (GDC), and Independent Power Producers year. The rate of connectivity was however affected by an upward (IPPs) mainly from sources such as geothermal (646MW), natural review of connection charges commensurate with increased cost gas (1,050MW), wind (630MW), and coal (1,920MW). of materials and operations. In order to mitigate this trend and to put the rate of new connections back on track in line with the country’s social and economic objectives, the Government initiated a Shs.2.7 billion subsidy programme in August 2013 to finance some categories of new connections for three months until December 2013. The subsidy enabled the customers to continue paying for new connections at the previous rate while the report of an ongoing study that will inform the optimal fees to be charged for new connections is awaited. Aware that some potential customers face challenges in raising funds to pay for new connections, the Company has also been collaborating with various partners to avail credit to potential customers who require financing for this purpose. Under this arrangement, a €4.5 million (Shs.450 million) revolving fund pilot loan facility supported by the Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) has already benefited more than 44,000 customers.

Ouko, CBS based on the audit and report in accordance with the provisions of AUDITOR-GENERAL Section 15 of the Public Audit Act, 2003. The audit was conducted in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing. 10 October 2013 Those standards require compliance with ethical requirements and that the audit be planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosure in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the Auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entry’s preparations and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
