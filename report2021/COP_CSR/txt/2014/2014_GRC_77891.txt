Now we see a light on the horizon and although we are still grieving the loss of Petros Vettas, Chairman of Attica Group, last April, this Address is encouraging for better journeys with you, our passengers, as our destination. As regards the Adriatic Sea market where four of our vessels operated in 2013, the Group’s transportation volumes compared to the previous year increased by 11.1% in passengers, 9.2% in private vehicles, and decreased by 1.2% in freight units. The Group’s transportation volumes in all domestic routes in the Aegean (Cyclades, Dodecanese, North Aegean and Crete) increased by 5.3% in passengers, 2.3% in private vehicles and 4.3% in freight units compared to 2012. The 3.8 million passengers who traveled with our vessels in 2013 is an indicator which shows that the tourism engine has restarted, with all the beneﬁts it will bring to Greek economy and culture, but also shows that the communities of coastal areas have come back to life, that our routes once again bring people together, and that people join forces and keep their hopes up. The best results for the Company in 2013, which however remain in negative territory, are reﬂected in the selected ﬁgures of the Group’s results shown in this year’s Social Responsibility Report. Lately, however, all the people who travel with us, but also all the people who work with Attica Group and make these journeys possible get a glimpse of optimism. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the improved ﬁnancials of the Group, as see in the presentation of results for FY 2013, also came as a result of our established policy to contribute to environmental protection. As a result, not only did we reduced our administrative expenses, but also placed particular emphasis on the energy management of our vessels’ routes, which, along with the streamlining of our routes and the slight reduction in fuel prices, resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the cost of fuels and lubricants (down by 9.9% in relation to 2012). We perceive corporate responsibility as an multilayer extensive grid of obligations and actions. People are and have always been our priority, and our starting point is our personnel. Our employees are one of the four pillars of action developed in the context of our Corporate Social Responsibility program, to which we are fully committed. 880 people work for Attica group, of which 176 are ofﬁce-based and 704 work on board our vessels, who are our company’s main asset and the driving force behind all of our activities. Another pillar of action is our contribution to the environment and local societies. Loyal to its values, our company remains committed to the raising of environmental awareness and social welfare, taking all efforts to help in the best way possible. One of our new efforts taken in 2013 was the recording of measurements of power and water consumption at our company’s registered ofﬁce. This enables us not only to have an exact picture of consumption, but mainly to set targets to reduce it year by year. At the same time, for one more year we continued our admittedly successful programs of “Sun Protection” and “Blood Ties”. In the context of the ﬁrst program, we collaborated with NGO Melampous for the free examination of people in Paros and Naxos and informed people about the consequences of exposure to the sun and methods of prevention. In the context of the second program, the Company’s employees, both ofﬁce-based and on board vessels, organized days for voluntary blood donation, demonstrating in this simple and selﬂess way their own perception of “Blood Ties”. Our constant presence in the islands has resulted in relationships between many of our people and islanders who they regularly contact and now address by their ﬁrst name. This is a very substantial relationship built over 13 years. We also support parents associations in small local societies, charitable and non-proﬁt organizations, Metropolitan churches, cultural and athletic clubs. We collaborate with the doctors of each community and are present and offering our assistance wherever needed. Of course, we will always be there to foster any initiatives that could beneﬁt the residents of the areas reached by our vessels, in relation to the environment, local economies and social development. To us in Attica Group, “moral entrepreneurship” has become both a way of work and life. Our priority is people next to us, our colleagues at the ofﬁce, our fellow passengers on board, our fellow citizens or neighbors in an island, a village or a city. It is the small land where we live. It is the big land where we belong. The journey strengthens communication. Communication brings cooperation and harmony. We share our visions and experiences. We protect our environment. We foster our traditions. We build civilization. These values are of paramount importance now, more than ever. Enjoy your reading! Spiros Ch.

Coastal shipping and Greece As a Mediterranean country with almost the longest coastline in Europe, Greece has been traditionally a strong player in coastal shipping. It could not be otherwise, since Greece is a leader in shipping, with its numerous islands with varying landscape, the mild climate and sunshine. The above, combined with the favourable sea conditions for sailing and the short distances between coasts, strengthen the interest of tourists who are successfully and consistently served by the country’s lines. As a result, maritime transport aims to support the country by contributing to its cultural and economic growth, both locally and generally. It connects people, products, cultures, civilizations and strengthens the development of remote regions, offering them a transport and communication channel. Historically the role of coastal shipping in Greece was closely connected and intertwined with economic prosperity and tourist entertainment. However, the most important aspect of the industry’s contribution is connection, a vital factor for local communities, which leads to communication between people and ultimately acts as a decisive factor to improve the daily life of people living in remote regions, but also of other Greek islands. 2.

History ATTICA HOLDINGS S.A. with distinctive title Attica Group was established in 1918 and its current name was given by a decision of the Ordinary General Meeting of shareholders of 03.06.2004 (GGI S.A. & LLC 6333/18.06.2004). The Company is classiﬁed, according to the classiﬁcation of the Economic Operation Sectors (STAKOD 2003) of the NSSG, under code 741.5 on Holding Companies Activity Management. The Company is registered in the Companies Register of the Ministry of Development, Department of Companies and Credit, with registry number 7702/06/Β/86/128. Its operation in the sector of passenger shipping through subsidiaries began in 1993. In 1999 Attica Group acquired 38.8% of the shares of ATHEX-listed Strintzis Lines Shipping S.A., which it increased to 48.6% the following year. In the same year, in 2000, it changed the company’s trade name to Blue Star Maritime S.A. and created the Blue Star brand. 15 The Blue Star ﬂeet's renewal started mid-2000 and was completed in June 2002 with the construction of ﬁve new generation Blue Star car-passenger ferries. On 3 October 2007 the ownership status of Attica Group changed when MARFIN INVESTMENT GROUP SA (MIG) directly and indirectly acquired 51.64% of the share capital and voting rights from the Company’s old reference shareholders. In September 2008 the Company’s head ofﬁces were relocated and all departments were centralized in the new ofﬁces at 123 125 Syngrou Ave & 3 Torva St, 11745 Athens. The Company’s registered ofﬁce was also transferred to the Municipality of Athens. In October of 2008 the newly built Superfast I, 24 knots speed, with a capacity of 950 passengers, 140 trucks and 100 cars was delivered. The vessel was deployed in the Patras – Igoumenitsa – Bari route in the Adriatic Sea. The Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of 02.12.2008 approved the merger, according to the provisions of article 68(2) -77(a) and 78 of C.L. 2190/1920, of articles 1-5 of Law 2166/1993, and in general the commercial legislation, as applicable, through the absorption of Blue Star Maritime S.A. and of the 100% subsidiary Superfast Ferries Maritime S.A. by Attica HOLDINGS S.A. The said merger of the three SA’s was approved with decision number Κ2 15054/23.12.2008 of the Ministry of Development. As a result of the merger, Attica Group issued 37,440,020 dematerialized common registered shares, with a nominal value of €0.83 each, which it distributed to the shareholders of merged company Blue Star Maritime S.A., according to the determined exchange ratio.

Therefore, the Company’s share capital amounted to €134,811,920 divided into 162,424,000 dematerialized common registered voting shares, with a nominal value €0.83 each. In February 2010 Superfast V which operated in the Adriatic Sea was sold. As of 1 February 2010, Superfast Ferries became the ﬁrst shipping company worldwide to offer a new class of cabins with “PURE” technology, on the Patras-Igoumenitsa-Ancona line, in the Adriatic Sea. On 20 November 2010, BLUE STAR DELOS, the ﬁrst of the two new Group’s vessels ordered in June 2009 was launched at the shipyards of Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co. (DSME), South Korea. In January 2011 the Company’s Share Capital increase was completed with the payment of cash and a pre-emptive right for old shareholders. 29,236,320 new shares were issued, with sale price €0.83 per share, and €24.3 million were drawn in total. In March 2011, Superferry II, a ship built in 1974, was sold to GOLDEN STAR FERRIES SHIPPING CO. The ship was delivered at the port of Raﬁna. In the same month, SeaSmiles, the new single Customer Loyalty Scheme was launched for Attica Group passengers travelling with Superfast Ferries and Blue Star Ferries, in the Adriatic Sea, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete and the islands of the Northeast Aegean Sea, offering exclusive privileges, unique gifts, special offers and high quality services to its members. 16 From April 2011, BLUE STAR 1 and BLUE STAR 2 which serve the Dodecanese lines, and SUPERFAST XII, are equipped with a new, innovative air and surface puriﬁcation technology system, the “PURE cabins”. On 8 June 2011, Attica Group proceeded to a partnership of high strategic importance with ANEK Lines for combined routes by vessels of the two companies on the international Patras-Igoumenitsa-Ancona line, and on the PiraeusHeraklion line. The newly built vessel BLUE STAR DELOS was delivered in October 2011 at the shipyards of Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co. (DSME), South Korea. The ship started its itineraries on the Piraeus-Paros-Naxos-IosSantorini on Sunday 13 November.

The ultra-modern ship BLUE STAR PATMOS was delivered in June 2012 at the shipyards of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. Ltd, South Korea. The construction of this new ship marked the launch of a new line for Attica Group, on the Piraeus-Chios-Mytileni route, where the company previously had no presence, redeﬁning the level of transportation services to the islands of the North-East Aegean Sea. BLUE STAR PATMOS is the second of the two vessels ordered. It is a high-speciﬁcation ship with a total length of 145.50 meters, speed at 26 knots and a capacity of 2,000 passengers and 427 passenger cars or 60 trucks and 145 passenger cars.

Signiﬁcant events in 2013 In April 2013, the Management of ATTICA HOLDINGS SA sold RoPax SUPERFAST VI to Genting Group for the total price of €54 million, paid in cash. SUPERFAST VI will be replaced in the Patras-Igoumenitsa-Ancona route by another ship of the Group. The estimated loss for Attica Group from this transaction will stand at approximately €6.3 million and will be included in the results for 2012. On repayment of bank borrowings, the commission for the sale of the ship and other transacting costs, the remaining amount is estimated to stand at approximately €21 million. At the end of the same month came the devastating loss of Petros Vettas, Chairman of Attica Group. Following this sad loss, ATTICA GROUP made an announcement to investors about changes to the duties of BoD members. More speciﬁcally, the Board of Directors met on 1 May 2013 and decided not to replace the deceased director and continue with the remaining term of ofﬁce of the current Board with eight members. During the same month, the Board of Directors of “ANEK SA SUPERFAST ENDEKA (HELLAS) INC & Co” joint service announced the renewal of the joint service’s term until 31/05/2017 with regard to the combined itineraries on the international Patras-Igoumenitsa-Ancona route, and on the Piraeus-Heraklion route. The strategic move made by the managements of ANEK SA and ATTICA HOLDINGS SA to incorporate a joint service in May 2011 has resulted in important synergies and offered new growth potential for both lines, by managing increasing ship operating costs and maintaining the high level of offered services. By renewing the joint venture’s term until 2017, the Board of Directors aims to make best use of the potential that the cooperation of the two companies offers to both lines, by capitalizing on the encouraging results that their twoyear cooperation has brought and aiming to further improve the itineraries and services. 17 8.

Accordingly, loss after taxes for the Group in 2013 stood at €10.13 million compared to loss after taxes of €53.98 million in 2012. It should be noted that the results for 2012 include loss of €20.36 million resulting from the impairment of assets (ships) in the Group’s assets, as well as a book loss of €6.40 million which resulted from the sale of Superfast VI. Speciﬁcally for FY 2013, the turnover represented domestic lines to 61.0% and the Adriatic Sea to 39.0%, while the corresponding ﬁgures in 2012 were 59.5% for domestic lines and 40.5% for the Adriatic Sea. 18 The Group's activities by geographic region are as follows: As regards domestic lines, the Group operated the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, the Piraeus-Heraklion and the Piraeus Chios Mytileni routes, with BLUE STAR PAROS, BLUE STAR NAXOS, BLUE STAR DELOS, BLUE STAR ITHAKI, BLUE STAR 1, BLUE STAR 2, DIAGORAS, BLUE HORIZON, SUPERFAST XII (until March 2013) and BLUE STAR PATMOS. In this market, the Group's turnover for 2013 stood at € 159.52 million compared to €152.21 million in 2012, up by 4.8%, while ferry itineraries were increased by 1.5% compared to 2012. The above turnover includes compensation for the performance of public service itineraries for the competent Ministry, standing at € 11.72 million compared to € 11.47 million in 2012. Operating expenses were decreased to €120.72 million compared to €132.01 million in 2012, mainly due to the reduction in fuel prices. This decrease in operating expenses combined with the increased turnover resulted in proﬁt before taxes, ﬁnancing, investing results and total depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the domestic market of €30.45 million compared to €14.89 million in 2012. In 2013 domestic lines posted loss after taxes of €7.25 million compared to loss after taxes of €15.73 in 2012, including losses resulting from the impairment of assets (vessels) of €5.81 million. In the Adriatic Sea, the Group operated the Patras-Igoumenitsa-Ancona route with SUPERFAST XI and SUPERFAST VI, which was sold in March 2013 and replaced by SUPERFAST XII, and Patras-Igoumenitsa-Bari route, with SUPERFAST I and SUPERFAST II. In this market, the Group's turnover for 2013 amounted to €100.64 million compared to €103.79 million in 2012, down by 3.0%, while ferry itineraries were decreased by 0.8% compared to 2012.

The above presentation of ﬁnancial performance demonstrates that the Group’s operating results were signiﬁcantly improved in 2013, considering the challenging economic environment and the recession in which the country has fallen, which has markedly reduced consumption costs for citizens, while competition among the companies of the sector remains strong. However, the Group’s improved ﬁnancial standing has been the result of a number of actions taken by the Management, mainly related to cuts in administrative expenses and the active management of itineraries, aimed to improve transportation volumes per itinerary. The improved results were also backed by lower fuel prices which, combined with the optimization of itineraries, has reduced the Group’s costs for fuel and lubricants by 9.9% in relation to 2012. 19 20 Section ΙΙ: Social Responsibility Management Vision & Strategy Management Practices Social Responsibility Organizational Structures Management Systems Stakeholders Participation & Recognition 21 22 1.

It is worth noting that: • In 2013 there were no incidents of discrimination at the workplace of Attica Group. • The percentage of women in the total number of land-based employees is 53.4%. 35 4. Labour rights Union bodies The Group respects the rights of employees to trade unionism and to participate in labour unions, and accepts Law 1264/82 on the democratization of the trade union movement and the establishment of employees’ trade union freedoms, as amended and supplemented by laws 1915/90 and 2224/94, the provisions of which apply to all personnel employed under private-law salaried employment contracts both in the private and the public sector. Employees of our Group actively participate in and are elected members of collective bodies (Hellenic Association of Employees in shipping and tourism) 5. Development of employees Training of employees The optimization and continuous training of our people is a key component of the operation of the Group’s HR Department. Due to the increasing workload after the acceptance of BLUE STAR DELOS and BLUE STAR PATMOS, 440 hours of seminars were held in 2013, compared to 113 hours in 2012. Information on how to deal with emergencies involving passengers with Diabetes Mellitus In July 2011, Attica Group and MITERA Children’s Hospital, in cooperation with the Hellenic Diabetes Federation, completed the information meetings on how to deal with emergency situations of passengers suffering from Diabetes Mellitus. Now all onboard and land personnel are equipped with the necessary knowledge and tools, including testing strips, to deal with potential incidents. Evaluation and development of employees Since 2008, the Company has been implementing the Performance Management System for the Group’s Administrative Personnel. A similar Evaluation System is being implemented for our onboard staff, with performance appraisal conducted at two hierarchical levels. This Performance Management System is developmental in nature, and the purpose of the exercise is to identify the strengths and the weaknesses of staff, in order to develop their individual performance in general, by capitalizing on their skills and improving their weaker points. This evaluation procedure aims to create better professionals and more efﬁcient employees. The entire Administrative staff of Attica Group participates in this evaluation process and soon this system will be linked to our Compensation and Beneﬁts System. 36 6. Brieﬁng of employees The systematic provision of information and interactive and open communication between the Management and employees are key to the Group. The communication of corporate and other affairs related to Attica Group is achieved using various means, including: • E-mails • Personal notices to target audiences • Information by mail • Posters and other printed publications, information material etc. • Intragroup newsletter Employees are informed about the company’s internal procedures in relation to: • Recruitment -relocations • Training • Evaluation of performance • Leaves absences • Business travels • Evacuation of management building • Health & Safety • Work in shifts • Discounts to personnel • Correspondence • Employee private insurance plan • Other information documents 37 38 Section ΙV: Market Corporate Governance Fair Competition Responsible Marketing Customer Service & Satisfaction Communication With The Market 39 40 1. Corporate governance Having placed transparency in our relations with all Group holders, including shareholders, employees, partners, suppliers, investors, etc, among our top priorities, Attica Holdings SA has prepared a Corporate Governance Code which represents a system of practices that describes the way in which the Group is managed and controlled. The Code is compliant and in line with the best governance practices, both as established by the Company and implemented in accordance with the Greek Law, in the context of corporate governance and the general principles of corporate governance applied in countries of the European Union. The Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies, as published by the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises (January 2011), and its amendment by the Hellenic Corporate Governance Council in the context of its revision, were taken into account. Within the scope of Corporate Government principles: • There are 3 executive members, 2 non-executive members and 2 independent non-executive members in the seven-member Board of Directors of the Company. • The responsibilities of Chairman and CEO Director do not fall to the same person. • In the Company’s Internal Rules of Procedure, as drawn up and implemented, there is a full description of the tasks and duties of all the organizational units of the company and the Group. • An Audit Committee was established and operates according to the provisions of article 37 of Law 3693/2008. • There is an Internal Audit Department in operation, as well Corporate Communications and Shareholders' Support services. The Corporate Governance Code has been posted on the ofﬁcial Attica Group website, in the context of transparent, uninterrupted and discrimination-free information. Audit committee The General Meeting of Shareholders, in order to ensure the legitimate and safe operation of the Company at all times, as well as the restriction of ﬁnancial and legal risks, decided in implementation of the existing legal framework and the provisions on corporate governance aiming at transparency and the coordinated supervision of the auditors’ works, to establish an Audit Committee. The Committee comprises three members (one non-executive and two independent non-executive members). The Audit Committee reports to the Board of Directors. The Committee primarily aims to support the Board of Directors in performing its supervisory duties, to ensure transparency in all the corporate activities and to fulfill obligations and responsibilities towards the shareholders and the supervisory authority. Internal Audit Department The Internal Audit Department operates as an independent body of the Company and is supervised by the Audit Committee. The Department’s main objective is to conduct efﬁcient audits of the operations and approved procedures of all the organizational units of the Company and the Group, in order to ensure their smooth and efﬁcient operation within the framework of the adopted strategic policy and the achievement of the qualitative and quantitative stated objectives. The Internal Audit Department’s main duties are to: • Plan the annual schedule of audits, as well as the individual schedules and their implementation seeking to determine and protect the observance of policies and procedures, as well as the effective and legal operation of the Company and the Group’s subsidiary Companies; • Provide the Management with the necessary information regarding the efﬁciency of operations and the maximization of the Company’s performance; • Study the range and quality of the internal audit system and to propose more efﬁcient procedures for its improvement, in order to reach its business objectives; 41 • Monitor the implementation and the continuous compliance with Internal Operating Regulations and the Articles of Association, in order to identify and evaluate any possible operational risks in a timely fashion; • Control the implementation of the legislation related to the Company and in particular the legislation on companies and stock markets; • Control the Company’s organizational structure and operations. The Internal Audit Department operates on this procedural basis and conducts controls in order to evaluate the Company’s operational efﬁciency. Its purpose is to develop a climate of communication and cooperation with the other Departments – Services, so that the development of the audit culture ensures the protection of the Company’s interests and the acceptance of the Internal Audit as a tool for providing assistance to those being audited. To achieve its objective, the Internal Audit Department works closely with external auditors to avoid duplication of audits in ﬁelds where audits have already been conducted, and emphasize on areas of risk. Corporate Announcements Service The main duty of this Service is to ensure the Company’s compliance with the obligations regarding the provision of information to investors and the supervisory authorities, as stated in the existing institutional framework. Additionally, the Division is responsible for the Company’s communication with the Stock Exchange Authorities, the Media and any other competent bodies. The Corporate Announcements Service is responsible for planning and publishing all announcements related to investors. Shareholder Support Service The Service is responsible for the immediate and equal information of shareholders and for supporting them in exercising their rights based on the law and the Articles of Association. The Shareholders Support Service seeks to promptly inform investors regarding any important issues and especially on matters arising from the Company’s corporate activity, publications and distribution of dividends. In addition, the Service provides information regarding the Company’s General Meetings, as well as their decisions. 2. Fair competition The Company undertakes to adapt its strategy to the requirements of the Competition Commission both locally and at European level, while respecting the legislative framework on competition (competition law). Our Company has not been subject to any legal actions for breach of competition law during the reporting period. 3. Responsible Marketing Attica Group follows the principles of the Greek Code of Advertising Marketing Communication of the Communication Control Board, which makes sure that its communication material is lawful, decent, honest and truthful while respecting human dignity and does not imply any form of discrimination such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability or sexual orientation. The code and the principles it contains have been adopted and implemented at national and international level by the competent self-regulating bodies. The code and other regulatory provisions concerning advertising and marketing communication are observed by all entities involved in the process of marketing communication. To this end, the Group’s Marketing Division performs audits of advertisements before their communication and in some cases the procedure is implemented in cooperation with the company’s legal department. It is worth noting that in 2013 there have been no withdrawals of communication material and no fine has been imposed by the competent authorities. 42 4. Customer service & satisfaction Customer Service Department Attica Group’s Customer Service & Loyalty department, recognizing the importance of customers, focuses on the best possible service & satisfaction, through the proper and decent handling of customer requests. Via the Customer Service & Loyalty department, the Company aims to provide quality services to customers, namely to provide substantial service based on the customers’ actual needs, and covers issues related to domestic and international lines. The company’s Customer Service Department undertakes the receipt, handling and evaluation of complaints through a special collection system of complaints made by phone or in writing via email and/or contact forms. Upon completion of the evaluation process and in cooperation with the relevant departments, Customer Service responds to all complaints, requests and suggestions, acting as a bridge of communication between the company and its customers. Finally, the Management is updated on a monthly basis in relation to all complaints per vessel and in cooperation with the concerned departments analyses the extent to which the services provided by the Group have failed to meet a customer’s quality requirements, with a view to the Company’s continuous development and improvement. Customer Service & Loyalty is available to the public from Monday to Friday, 09:00 to 20:00. Attica Group insists on an open and customer-oriented policy, always focusing on maximum customer satisfaction and service, through Customer Service & Loyalty. In order to enhance this concept and ensure the quality of the provided services, the company lists a number of services offered on domestic and international lines.

More speciﬁcally, in 2013 the total number of passengers was 3,234,394 for Blue Star Ferries and 529,201 for Superfast Ferries. See section I-2 for more information. All data collected was communicated to management and relevant departments to carry out the review of the results. SeaSmiles loyalty programme Through the new SeaSmiles Loyalty Programme which was launched on 1 March 2011, the Company aims to further improve its services and create more ﬂexible methods of service, developing substantive and close ties with its customers. This is a unique loyalty programme for Attica Group passengers traveling with Superfast Ferries and Blue Star Ferries in the Adriatic Sea, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, the islands of the North Aegean Sea and Crete. The programme is designed to provide exclusive beneﬁts, unique gifts, special offers and high-quality services to its members. Each member card is strictly personal and not transferable. The cards are personalized and may be used on all Attica Group vessels and to any destination. By 31 December 2013, the programme numbered 73,563 active members in total, of which 59,587 were domestic line passengers, and 13,976 were international line passengers. In more detail, since the programme’s inception on 1 March 2011 through 31 December 2013, the active members of the programme were as follows: 2011 2012 2013 Total Domestic lines 7,221 20,035 32,331 59,587 International lines 5,861 4,497 3,618 13,976 Total 13,082 24,532 35,949 73,563 44 5. Communication with the market We are part of the market’s improvement One of the Group’s key objectives is to have the greatest possible contribution to the business life of the country and more speciﬁcally to improve the industry in which it operates. For this reason, the Group aims to have a strong presence in entities and organizations that publicly express views on business and industry-speciﬁc issues, while forming a communication channel with political leadership. Also, the company’s representation in unions closely associated with the maritime industry and coastal shipping promotes the spirit of cooperation between passenger shipping companies, which can be positive for consumers. • Participation in the Association of Passenger Shipping Companies: The mission of this Association is the further modernisation and development of modern Greek passenger shipping creating a competitive national capital in European and global economic competition. The object of the Association is the actual implementation of fair competition rules among its members, the protection of its members from the imposition of any kind of legislature, and ﬁnding the necessary solutions to ensure the survival and growth of the passenger shipping industry. It is worth noting that the President of the Association is an member of Attica Group’s Board of Directors. • Participation in the Hellenic Chamber of Shipping: The Hellenic Chamber of Shipping is the State’s official consultant on shipping issues. It is a public-law entity and aims to protect and promote the interests of the Greek Merchant Marine, through the cooperation of all its members and the rational coordination of their actions. We raise awareness among consumers Attica Group informs the public and all other interested members through targeted communication actions. For more information, see sections IV-3 and IV-3. We ensure the reliability of data It is the obligation of all employees to protect conﬁdential privileged information of the Group. This information is an asset of the Group, its use is limited to colleagues on a need-to-know basis in order to perform their duties, and may not be disclosed to anyone outside the Group, not even to relatives. Also, employees must refrain from disclosing confidential information relating to the Group's operations, the cooperation of customers with the Group or any other personal and financial issues of customers and personnel members to unauthorized individuals both during and after their service at the Group. Certain Services/Departments and members of personnel that have access to conﬁdential and/or privileged information due to the nature of their duties and position will be subject to the additional restrictions set out in the Internal Rules of Procedure”. 45 46 Section V: Environment Organization & Management Raw Materials and Waste Management Information and Awareness – Raising Climate Change Biodiversity Water 47 48 1.Organization and management Attica Group, via Superfast Ferries and Blue Star Ferries, places particular importance on environmental issues and the aspects that are most likely to be affected by their operation. The companies of the Group assesses annually the environmental actions they implement, in order to continuously improve their results and to minimize the overall impact of the Group’s operations on the environment. At the same time, they evaluate any environmental issues related to the Group’s operations, and respond to them through a structured and multifaceted environmental policy. The most important of these issues are: emissions, discharges into the sea, waste management, use of raw materials and resources and the environmental demands of local societies. It is worth noting that Group companies Superfast Ferries and Blue Star Ferries were the ﬁrst Greek companies in the passenger shipping which received the ISO 14001:1996 Environmental Management certiﬁcation. All Group ships have been certiﬁed based on the same standard. For more information, see section I-2. The Group's environmental consciousness is inseparable from our commitment to providing superior customer service and satisfaction of our passengers. The Group's environmental policy objectives are to: • Continue to invest in new technologies and to apply environmentally friendly methods; • Minimize the negative impact from engine operation, through their timely and proper maintenance; • Encourage its personnel, both onboard and ofﬁce-based, to adopt environmentally friendly methods and to develop their environmental conscience, through proper information and training; • Actively participate in organizations which promote the principles of environmental safety and protection; • Participate in international research and development programmes which promote efﬁciency, responsibility and reduction of pollution in the shipping sector; • Be kept up to date with regard to environmental issues and to adopt appropriate new practices. Environmental policy management The employees of Attica Group are the Group’s most important asset. Acting as the ambassadors of the corporate culture towards environmental responsibility, our people provide decisive input in issues of prevention, safety and best practices in the direction of minimizing environmental impact. The Group invests in the training of its people, while the eagerness of employees to participate and the initiatives that emerge in the context of open dialogue, are remarkable. Each vessel has designated ofﬁcers who are responsible for the implementation of the environmental measures adopted. At the same time, the Group’s ofﬁces are staffed with qualiﬁed engineers and designated ofﬁcers who monitor performance and set the guidelines for the general and specialized environmental training needed. Also, onboard and ofﬁce-based staff systematically participate in environmental emergency exercises, in cooperation with the local authorities. 49 2. Raw materials and waste management Environmental protection is a serious area of action for Attica Group. The scarcity of natural resources, climate change, the endangered species of ﬂora and fauna, etc, all contribute to a deep environmental crisis which imposes that proper practices are adopted for sustainable development. Attica Group recognizes the critical nature of the situation and has adopted good practices and measures which aim at the effective and rational management and safe disposal of waste and the sustainable use of available resources. Recycling, as a primary objective of our environmental actions, combined with employee training and awarenessraising, has led to reduced volumes of waste and further use, thus signiﬁcantly contributing to the preservation of natural resources and energy saving. Cooking oil collection Our top priority is the adoption of innovative practices related to environmental protection; as a result, the Group has included in its actions the collection of cooking oil, a practice which applies to all ships. Considering that one liter of oil can contaminate one million liters of water, employees on board all ships of the Group collect used cooking oil which is then delivered to an authorized company which subsequently treats oil in a legal, safe and environmentally-correct way for the production of biofuel and biolubricants. It is worth noting that biofuels and biolubricants produced after the appropriate treatment of these oils are more environmentally friendly because they do not cause air pollution like fossil fuels and lubricants. Overall, the Group produced and rationally managed: • 2009: 5,375 liters of waste cooking oil • 2010: 8,645 liters, up by 32.7% compared to 2009 • 2011: 17,575 liters, up by 49.2% compared to 2010. This signiﬁcant improvement is due to the extension of the initiative to the vessels of Superfast Ferries as well. • 2012: 21,065 liters, up by 17% compared to 2011 • 2013: 18,220 liters, down by 16% compared to 2012 Cooking oil (liters) 25,000 , 21,065 20,000 , 18,220 17,575 15,000 10,000 , 8,645 5,375 5,000 0 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 50 Paper recycling The main priority in this direction is paper recycling at the ofﬁces of the Group. Nowadays, the protection of forests, and thus of the biodiversity, is crucial, but wasting paper unfortunately continues to be a daily practice. If we consider that one ton of paper is equivalent to 17 large trees, and that 93% of business waste is paper, then we can comprehend how paper recycling can “turn the page” and make a difference towards a new, viable future. In Attica Group we seek to reduce total paper consumption with daily practices such as double-sided printing. At the same time, new initiatives are being evaluated to further promote rational management of paper and to reduce required quantities of printed advertising material. Between 2011 and 2013 we managed to keep total paper consumption both at the company’s ofﬁces and onboard most of the ships unchanged. In particular: The supply of recycled paper to meet the needs of the Company’s ofﬁces was as follows: • 2011: 705 boxes (x 5 packs = 3,525 packs) • 2012: 700 boxes (x 5 packs = 3,500 packs) • 2013: 720 boxes (x 5 packs = 3,600 packs) The supply of non-recycled paper to met the needs of ships was as follows: • 2011: 598 boxes (x 5 packs = 2,990 packs) Refers to the supplies of 12 ships: BLUE STAR1, BLUE STAR 2, BLUE STAR ITHAKI, BLUE STAR PATMOS, BLUE STAR NAXOS, DIAGORAS, BLUE STAR DELOS, SUPERFAST I, SUPERFAST II, SUPERFAST VI, SUPERFAST XI, SUPERFAST XII • 2012: 585 boxes (x 5 packs = 2,925 packs) Refers to the supplies of 13 ships: BLUE STAR 1, BLUE STAR 2, BLUE STAR ITHAKI, BLUE STAR PATMOS, BLUE STAR NAXOS, DIAGORAS, BLUE STAR DELOS, BLUE STAR PATMOS, SUPERAST I, SUPERFAST II, SUPERFAST VI, SUPERFAST XI, SUPERFAST XII • 2013: 640 boxes (x 5 packs = 3,200 packs) Refers to the supplies of 13 ships: BLUE STAR 1, BLUE STAR 2, BLUE STAR ITHAKI, BLUE STAR PAROS, BLUES STAR NAXOS, DIAGORAS, BLUE STAR DELOS, BLUE STAR PATMOS, BLUE HORIZON, SUPERAST I, SUPERFAST II, SUPERFAST XI, SUPERFAST XII More speciﬁcally, from 2008 up to and including 2010, in collaboration with the non-proﬁt organization Klimaka , the company has recycled: • 2008: 17,574 liters of paper • 2009: 31,712 liters of paper • 2010: 36,290 liters of paper It has been reported that since 2011 and Paper recycling (kg) according to a new modification, the 10,000 9,400 recommended measurement with regard 9,352 to paper recycling is made in kilos and corresponds to the quantity of paper 8,000 which was actually recycled. According to the Group’s available data, the following 6,000 quantities were recycled over the last two 5,000 years: 4,000 • 2011: 9,352 kg of paper • 2012: 9,400 kg of paper 2,000 • 2013: 5,000 kg of paper (estimate) 2011 2012 2013 51 Apart from paper recycled by the Group, many of our advertising pamphlets have been printed on chlorine-free paper, which consists of wood pulp ﬁber from certiﬁed controlled cultivations (Forest Stewardship Council CertiﬁedFSC). The Group uses this type of paper to print the annual Report of Sustainable Development (2007 – 2008 – 2009 – 2010), all Adriatic Sea line brochures, small cards with useful tips on dealing with climate changes as part of everyday practices, which are distributed onboard and via the Group’s partner agencies, as well as other corporate pamphlets and ashtrays for the beach. Based on the above, it is worth noting that the Social Responsibility Annual Reports since 2011 and the present report were not printed for environmental reasons. Both reports are available online, on the websites of Blue Star Ferries, Superfast Ferries and Attica Group. Recycling electrical & electronic appliances In 2012, 57 electrical & electronic devices, such as keyboards, computer monitors and printers were collected from vessels and the Group’s ofﬁces, posting an increase of 77% compared to 2011. In 2013, 69 devices were collected, increasing collection by 17% compared to 2012. Ink cartridge recycling (pc) 800 712 Ink cartridge recycling 665 600 Under the ink cartridge recycling programme, in 2013, 655 cartridges were collected in total from 400 370 the Group’s ofﬁces and vessels, posting a slight decline of 9%. 200 0 2011 2012 2013 Battery recycling The Group, in cooperation with the company AFIS (battery recycling), has placed special battery recycling bins in all ofﬁces and vessels for all battery types up to 1500 grams, whether primary (single use) or secondary (rechargeable). According to the available data of the Group, we collected from the ofﬁces and our ships and recycled: Battery recycling (kg) • 2008: 147 kg of batteries • 2009: 575 kg of batteries 12,000 , • 2010: 593 kg of batteries 10,358 , 10,000 • 2011: 10,358 kg of batteries. 8,621 This increase is due to the addition , 8,000 of larger batteries for recycling. • 2012: 8,621 kg of batteries 6,000 • 2013: 2,454 kg of batteries 4,000 2,454 2,000 593 575 0 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 52 Recycling of expired household medicinal products For the ﬁrst time in 2012, the Group proceeded to the collection and recycling of expired medicinal products with the aim to inform and raise awareness among its employees, but also to protect the environment and public health. The special collection of expired medicinal products is particularly important, as pharmaceutical substances that remain for a long time in the aquifer and in the soil can affect the food chain and signiﬁcantly burden the environment. This was a successful initiative, as we managed to collect 409 pieces. Year 2013 saw a rapid increase in the recycling of expired pharmaceuticals by 70%, representing 1,352 items in total Lamp recycling With an aim to set the example in the nationwide effort in relation to lamp recycling, in 2012 we limited the disposal of lamps at the Group’s ofﬁces and vessels, actively participating in environmental management and exploitation. The continuous improvement and upgrading of our environmental performance has been recognized by all employees of Attica Group and can be evidenced in their increasing participation in the programme. During 2012 we collected 800 lamps in total, while in 2013 we managed to more than double that number after we collected 1,900 lamps which were subsequently transferred to special collection points to be reused. Transport of recyclable materials With the aim of supporting and contributing to the development of recycling as an institution, as well as to enhance sustainable development, Attica Group offers free or discount tickets for the transport of recyclable materials. In particular, in 2013 too we cooperated with a number of entities, non-proﬁt organizations, schools and companies from local societies to transport materials to Athens. 3.Information and awareness-raising The concept of respect for the environment and, as a result, for people, is an integral part of the Group’s business policy. We achieve our goals through the collective actions of the people we interact with daily, including employees, passengers, partners, islanders, etc. Believing that smooth cooperation can lead to sustainable development, in addition to its compliance with legislative regulations and arrangements, the Group has also established practices and actions that focus on providing information to the public and raising awareness on issues related to sustainable development and environmental protection. We hold that a “unite and conquer” philosophy could drive a better future for our country. Participation in the “Earth Hour” For the second consecutive year, Attica Group supported the international initiative of WWF by participating in the “Earth Hour”, during which more than 150 countries around the world switched off the lights. On Saturday, 23 March, at 20:30, the Group switched off the lights at the ofﬁces on 123-125 Syngrou Avenue & 3 Torva st, and the outdoor lights on ships docked at the port of Piraeus, for one hour and in some cases until next Monday morning, sending a strong message of optimism about the need to protect the environment. 53 At the same time, the WWF action banner was posted on http://www.bluestarferries.gr and www.superfast.gr, aiming to mobilize website visitors and raise awareness on environmental protection. Further, particular emphasis was placed on providing information, raising awareness and mobilizing Attica Group employees and partners at land and sea, to encourage their participation in this symbolic action. Alternative – Environmentally friendly ways to travel We promote alternative and environmentally-friendly ways to travel, by offering travel packages combining “Train and ship” for destinations outside Europe. Beach ashtrays Attica Group was one of the ﬁrst companies that aimed to, and focused on, raising awareness among island visitors with regard to cigarette-end pollution of beaches. The Group’s operation lies in the production and distribution of beach ashtrays at port agencies and on-board all ships. It is estimated that a total of 1,128,500 beach ashtrays were printed and distributed by Attica Group during the period 2007-2013. Also, in the past ashtrays were handed out during volunteer beach cleaning actions organized in Amorgos and Naxos, while their distribution has also been supported on several occasions by the Traveller’s Icons magazine. Useful tips for planet protection For environmental reasons, in 2012 and 2013 the leaﬂets containing useful tips for tackling climate change through daily practices were replaced by posts on the ofﬁcial page of Blue Star Ferries on Facebook for dissemination through the company’s 61,500 friends. We support the efforts of entities Superfast Ferries and Blue Star Ferries are active members of HELMEPA, the Hellenic Marine Environment Protection Association, a non-proﬁt, non-governmental organization that aims to cultivate environmental awareness and concepts of safe operation in the shipping sector, through information, advertising and publicity. Attica Group is member of the Sustainable Mobility Group, the International Union of Railways (UIC) and the only shipping company which, together with 43 carrier companies-UIC members, signed the Declaration on Sustainable Mobility and Transport. Finally, there is continuous ﬂow of information and involvement in environmental issues through subscriptions to specialist publications. 54 4. Climate change Reduction of emissions The newly built ships BLUE STAR PATMOS and BLUE STAR DELOS were designed so as to achieve the best ship-building characteristics for high efﬁciency with improved special emissions coefﬁcients. In addition, by adopting: • an optimized hybrid propulsion-power generation system, • the most modern and automated air conditioning system, • the generalized use of energy-efﬁcient and low voltage LED bulbs, • the use of suitable laminated stadip glass panels, • the use of suitable new generation ceramic insulating materials, the required power is reduced, thus achieving a respective reduction of total emissions. We modernise our ﬂeet The Attica Group ﬂeet is one of the most modern ﬂeets in Europe, with newly built ships that meet all international regulations for the protection of the environment and sustainable development. The most important is the convention MARPOL 73/78 of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The launch of the brand new BLUE STAR DELOS on the Cyclades routes in November 2011 and of BLUE STAR PATMOS on the Chios-Mytilini route in July 2012, conﬁrm the Group’s consistency, which operates a ﬂeet of 13 ships with an average age of just 10 years, but also its contribution to the development of Greek islands. Examples of strict environmental criteria to improve the energy and environmental performance of the company’s feet: • The fuel used in the Group's ships comply with national and international regulations. • The oily bilge water residue, which is discharged in the sea, meets the 15 ppm limit set by the international and national regulations. • The antifouling paints are non-toxic, and non-poisonous for marine organisms. This is another practice, which was adopted before it became mandatory under international regulations. • All chemicals used in ships are environmentally friendly. • The use of substances that cause ozone depletion is prohibited. Any chemical additives in use must be environmentally compatible. Most of the water used onboard is desalinated, via special boilers. Only low consumption light bulbs are used onboard the Groups’ vessels, apart from emergency lighting. The warm air for heating in common areas and hot water used for sanitation purposes is generated via the heat exhaustion from the main engines through the specially designed installations. Energy consumption and saving Global economic enlargement and Western consumption trends and “quality” of life require the consumption of huge amounts of energy. Energy production, at least on current terms, entails the emission of greenhouse gases (mostly CO2). This is one of the most important indicators, since carbon dioxide is one of greenhouse gases that cause the most severe environmental impact. Realizing that energy consumption is one of the primary human activities that contribute to climate change and environmental pollution, Attica Group initiated in 2012 a programme to record and monitor direct and indirect energy consumption for the needs of the Company’s ofﬁces. The company’s total (direct and indirect) energy consumption was reduced from 1,120,800 (kwh) in 2012 to 982,400 (kwh) in 2013. 55 5. Biodiversity According to the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) WBCSD/CSI guidelines, “biodiversity” is deﬁned as the variability of living organisms from all sources, including the ecological complexes of which they are part, and diversity within and between species and of ecosystems (as deﬁned in the Convention on Biological Diversity). The intensiﬁed urbanization and the increase of infrastructures, the over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution of all kinds, and the introduction of alien species into ecosystems signiﬁcantly harm biodiversity. This is why Attica Group actively participates in the protection of ﬂora and fauna, aiming at preserving or disseminating environmental values. Support to “LIFE” programme Consistent to our commitment to support original initiatives that contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, in 2011 we proceeded to a special collaboration with the Hellenic Ornithological Society aimed at the collection of information to determine important bird areas (IBA) at sea. More speciﬁcally, all Blue Star Ferries and Superfast Ferries travelling to the Cyclades, the Dodecanese and Crete have leaﬂets available for the information of passengers about sea birds, the actions of LIFE Programme and the importance of the island and sea areas of the Aegean. During their journey, passengers onboard the Group’s ships can observe the Aegean seabirds. Using the seabird observation leaﬂet made available at the ships’ receptions, passengers can obtain adequate information to identify seabirds and contribute to the counting of their population in Greece, by ﬁlling in and handing in the special recording form at the reception or by posting their notes on www.ornithologiki.gr/seabirds. It is worth noting that in 2012 the Hellenic Ornithological Society received 428 written and 1,500 online records through the special form made available onboard Group ships and port ofﬁces, while in 2013 it received 46 written and 1,378 online forms. This important information and awareness-raising action, combined with the extensive participation of Attica Group passengers, provides signiﬁcant input to the scientists comprising Life programme, while the list of IBA at sea forms the scientiﬁc database that will be used to expand the marine network under Natura 2000. 56 6. Water Water usage by the Group includes consumption at the ofﬁces and onboard the 13 vessels of the company’s ﬂeet, as well as consumption of ofﬁce and ship personnel and passengers travelling with our ships daily. Therefore, Attica Group considered it imperative to record the company’s water consumption in order to minimize its footprint. In June 2013 the company sent an ofﬁcial announcement to all personnel working on board its ships, the main message being reduced consumption of drinking water in 2013 by adopting practices for the more rational use of water. Below follow some of the actions that were announced: 1. Check of meters before and at the end of water supply. Check and ﬁnal sign-off will only be made by an Ofﬁcer. 2. Awareness-raising among personnel and information are decisive factors to avoid waste. It is illustrative that a running tap consumes 15 liters of water per minute. 3. Use of high-pressure jets where possible. Proper maintenance and report to management on adequate numbers or not. 4. Proper maintenance of the water production equipment and immediate reports to the technical department in case of faults. 5. Full use of produced water (cleaning, garage/window washing, etc). 6. Water saving labels at all necessary points. 7. Immediate repair of leaks (pipes, taps, shower heads, toilet tanks, etc). In all cases, the company procedures must be followed by ﬁlling in a damage report and by reporting the problem in writing. It is illustrative that a dripping tap can waste about 90 liters of water per week. 8. External cleaning/washing limited to the absolutely necessary in case of rain/bad weather. This initiative has resulted in a reduction of water consumption on the following ships of the Group’s ﬂeet: SUPERFAST I, SUPERFAST XI, SUPERFAST XII, DIAGORAS, BLUE STAR PAROS, BLUE STAR NAXOS, BLUE STAR DELOS, BLUE STAR PATMOS. According to available data of the Group, total water consumption at the ofﬁces and our ships is as follows: • 2012: 1,864 cubic meters at the central ofﬁces at 111,322 on vessels • 2013: 1,816 cubic meters at the central ofﬁces and 120,014 on vessels Water consumption (m3) 150,000 120,014 111,322 100,000 Ofﬁces 50,000 Vessels 0 1,816 1,864 2013 2012 57 58 Section VΙ: Society With Local Societies as our Destination We Support Local Societies Information to the Public Volunteering Cooperation With Non-Governmental Organizations 59 60 1. With local societies as our destination The local communities in which we operate have always been our priority in the development of a comprehensive Corporate Social Responsibility programme that listens and responds to needs and at the same time creates the necessary conditions for a better quality of life in local communities. Proving that the sea does not only separate but can also unite places, destinations, people, concepts, ideas, Attica Group fosters a wide range of local society actions and initiatives, from environmental care, culture and education, to sports and health. In this context, the Group consistently responds to a host of requests related to donations or indirect sponsorships to associations in islands of the Aegean. Tradition, culture and sports in particular have long been an extensive area of social contribution for the Group. Further, every year we offer a large number of discount or free tickets to associations, entities, non-proﬁt organizations, unions, festivals, etc, thus reducing the costs for relevant trips. At the same time, the company has incorporated in its overall programme of Social Responsibility a number of initiatives aimed to aid local society on a social and an environmental level, and to substantially contribute to development and awareness-raising. These include reliable and consistent innovative actions that meet the expectations and needs of the islanders. With local societies as our destination, we maximize our contribution. With local societies as our destination, we plan new initiatives for 2014. With local societies as our destination, we envisage a better future. 61 2. We support local societies “Sun Protection” Programme For the ﬁfth year, Attica Group joined forces with Greek islands under “Sun Protection” programme, by offering free tests of skin moles and organizing information speeches, in collaboration with “Melampous”, a non proﬁt organization for melanoma prevention and treatment, also with the aid of local doctors and entities. This is a programme that meets the expectations and needs of islanders and aims to reduce the frequency of skin diseases related to sun exposure, including melanoma. In June and July 2013, Blue Star Ferries and the medical team travelled to Paros and Naxos, were 694 adults and children were tested. At the same time, the speeches organized informed the islanders about the suggested methods of sun protection so as to eliminate any potential health risks. Further, Blue Star Ferries distributed informative pamphlets to islanders with references to the indicated methods of self-examination. Information leaﬂets are also available at the company’s central and port agencies as well as on board the domestic line vessels of Attica Group throughout the year. The table below shows the total number of people examined per year and the islands visited during the programme: Year Islands Examined 2008 Amorgos, Tilos, Astypalaia and Nisyros 255 2010 Donoussa, Schinoussa, Koufonisi and Iraklia 170 2011 Patmos and Leros 590 2012 Ios and Santorini 702 2013 Paros and Naxos 694 It is worth noting that during this year’s programme, 53 surgeries and histological examinations on skin lesions were performed; there were 12 cases in which malignant neoplasms were diagnosed. Like every year, histological examinations were carried out free of charge by “Melampous”, while the copies of the results were sent to the personal addresses of the persons examined. Also, 21 persons with skin lesions were photographed, while 56 persons were scanned using a special dermoscopy system. More speciﬁcally, in 2013: Surgeries Malignant neoplasms Photographed Scanned Paros 33 5 14 26 Naxos 23 7 7 30 In 2012: Surgeries Malignant neoplasms Photographed Scanned Ios 7 2 35 13 Santorini 11 1 43 19 Blue Star Ferries would like to deeply thank Dr. Konstantina Frangia, chairperson of MELAMPOUS and reference person for melanoma in Greece, as well as all volunteer doctors and nurses who have been offering their services to the programme all these years. 62 Considering that timely diagnosis can lead to cure, we commit to further expand “Sun Protection” by contributing to higher precautions and raising awareness among islanders. Since 2008, “Sun Protection” has been implemented in 14 Aegean islands in total, while it is worth noting that this action has been honored in the past in the category “Society and Entrepreneurship of the Ermis PR unit, organized every year by the Greek Association of Advertising and Communications Companies. Traditional professions Traditional professions are an integral part of the local cultural heritage of the Aegean. These were developed mainly by self-taught craftsmen who developed new conditions, used natural raw materials and shaped new trends in daily life. In 2010, Attica Group set sail on a new journey, one that focused on identifying, recording and promoting traditional craftsmen who insist on pursuing their crafts, despite the rapid technological progress. The “Traditional Professions” programme was based on personal interviews carried out on the islands reached by the company, and on the inner wealth of the people who keep our country’s folk tradition alive and firmly resist extinction of their craft. In implementing the programme, the company contacted older as well as young talented people who, in their own unique way, shared their commitment, passion and secrets of their professions, in personal interviews. Since the inception of the initiative to date, 24 islands of the Aegean have been mapped, while 65 cases of people who insist in preserving traditional crafts have been recorded in total. The presentation of the professions and personal interviews are available in a special section on the website of Blue Star Ferries (www.bluestarferries.gr), which had 1,816,127 visits in 2013 (unique users). Also, in an effort to promote traditional professions, relevant material is included in “On Blue”, the magazine of Blue Star Ferries, and on the ofﬁcial Facebook page of Blue Star Ferries. It is worth noting that this action was awarded the Bronze Ermis Award in 2013, in the category “Low Budget”, unit Ermis PR, at Ermis Awards, the major event of the communication industry, organized every year by the Hellenic Association of Communications Agencies. Further, the programme has also received the Corporate Affairs Excellence Award, in the category “Low Cost Action/Programme”, unit “Programme/Action Excellence”, organized by the Hellenic Management Association (HMA). Supporting “Agoni Grammi Gonimi 2013” programme For the 7th consecutive year, Attica Group was the major sponsor of programme “Agoni Grammi Gonimi”, which is also the name of the non-proﬁt organization it organizes it, under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and supported by the European Parliament. The aim of this programme is equal access to education and culture for all, regardless of their place of residence. The programme mainly addresses children, but is also open to adults. Among other things, the programme includes interactive events, training workshops, reading clubs, reading contests, theater shows, concerts with the involvement of some of the major cultural entities in Greece. In 2013 the programme travelled to 5 islands: Iraklia, Amorgos, Halki, Tilos and Antiparos. The enthusiasm and commitment demonstrated by all members of the team create a unique atmosphere in all events, and take the residents of the participating islands to a journey full of theatre, music, sports events and strong emotions, proving people in all areas can come together in fruitful procedures. This initiative of “Agoni Grammi Gonimi” reveals and promotes the needs for artistic expression to people who live in remote areas and have no access to such activities, and at the same time provides entertainment during the difficult long winter months. 63 We support sports Sports activities as a catalyst for a healthy body and a healthy mind that promotes values, ideals and teaches fair competition, has long been an area of social contribution for Attica Group. The increasing participation of youth in sporting activities combined with the signiﬁcant efforts made by local clubs and associations offer a ray of light that encourages and motivates us to continue investing in the future of the new generation. Wishing to play an important role in sports, Attica Group contributes by offering direct sponsorships and free or discount tickets to a number of entities, with a view to create new prospects for local societies.

To this day, the islands are proliﬁc in artistic output, promoted in the context of important cultural events that are organized every year. In this light, Attica Group has acted consistently and reliably by making donations and sponsoring a number of cultural associations in the Cyclades, the Dodecanese and the islands of Northeast Aegean, thus supporting local tradition and dissemination of the particular features of each place. Further, we have responded to requests from cultural associations and other entities across Greece offering tickets for the realization of their actions, including: • MUNICIPALITY OF ASTYPALAIA • INSTITUTE OF RESEARCH, TRADITION AND HISTORY OF THE DODECANESE • MUNICIPAL SPORTS & CULTURAL ORGANIZATION OF RHODES • SYMI THEATER OF RHODES • PUPPET THEATER AND STORYTELLING FESTIVAL • “PATMOS COLORS” CULTURAL AND MUSIC ASSOCIATION • RELIGIOUS MUSIC FESTIVAL, PATMOS • MUNICIPALITY OF PATMOS • CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL CLUB OF ASTYPALAIA • MYTILENI CHOIR • THEATER OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF LESVOS • NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF THE LESVOS PETRIFIED FOREST • FEDERATION OF LESVOS ASSOCIATIONS IN ATTICA • MUNICIPAL REGIONAL THEATER OF NORTH AEGEAN • HOLY CROSS CELEBRATION, UNION OF RESIDENTS OF DONOUSSA • MUNICIPAL COMMUNITY OF TINOS • ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM OF MYKONOS • AION 13TH FESTIVAL OF NAXOS • EUROPEAN MUSIC FESTIVAL 2013, NAXOS • “AGIOS GEORGIOS” ASSOCIATION OF KINIDAROS, NAXOS • MUNICIPALITY OF NAXOS AND SMALL CYCLADES • MUNICIPALITY OF ANTIPAROS, AGIA MARINA LONG WEEKEND CELEBRATION • MUNICIPALITY OF PAROS • CHARITABLE MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISE FOR THE CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF PAROS • MUNICIPALITY OF THIRA • “FRIENDS OF SANTORINI • ANIMASYROS 2013 • SYROS MUSIC ASSOCIATION • KAVAFY CULTURAL ASSOCIATION OF ANO SYROS • PERANTINOS MUSEUM • MUNICIPALITY OF LEROS • MUNICIPALITY OF KALYMNOS • MUNICIPAL REGIONAL THEATER OF PATRAS • “SOCRATES NOW” SHOW We support the Greeks in Europe In order to promote the Greek language and by extension the Greek culture, we sponsored the granting of tickets to the following Clubs and Associations, we present indicatively: • GREEK COMMUNITY OF ROTTERDAM AND GREATER AREA • GREEK INTERCULTURAL CENTRE OF BRUSSELS • BELGIAN CLUB OF GREEKS FROM HEPIRUS • GREEK COMMUNITY OF MAINTAL • GREEK COMMUNITY IN MARCHES • ASSOCIATION DES DAMES GRΕCQUES DE GENEVE • LA COMMUNITA ELLENICA EMILIA ROMAGNA • META GREEK-POLISH ASSOCIATION 65 We support people and sensitive social groups Furthermore, in the context of enhancing actions addressed to sensitive social groups, we also supported the following: • 9TH CONFERENCE OF THE INTERMUNICIPALITY HEALTH AND WELFARE NETWORK • MUNICIPALITY OF MEGISTI, TRANSPORT OF MEDICINAL MATERIALS FOR THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL HEALTH CENTRE OF MEGISTI, BLOOD TESTIT DEVICE & AMBULANCE • MUNICIPALITY OF LEROS, TRANSPORT OF DOCTORS FOR FREE TESTS • GENERAL HOSPITAL OF RHODES, TRANSPORT OF MEDICAL & MEDICINAL MATERIALS TO ISLANDS OF THE DODECANESE • MUNICIPALITY OF RHODES, FREE MAMMOGRAMS • MUNICIPALITY OF KOS, TRANSPORT OF MAMMOGRAPHY DEVICE FOR FREE TESTS • SENOLOGIC HELLENIC SOCIETY • MYTILENI KETHEA • ASSOCIATION FOR THE SUPPORT OF HEALTH CENTER IN IOS • PAROS EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EKAB) • WOMEN’S ASSOCIATION OF MARPISSA • REGION OF SOUTH AEGEAN, TRANSPORT OF MAMMOGRAPHY DEVICE FOR FREE TESTS & BLOOD • “AGIA PARASKEVI” ASSOCIATION, KATO MERIA-AMORGOS, TRANSPORT OF DOCTORS FOR FREE TESTS • MEDICINS DU MONDE FREE TESTS IN RHODES AND MEGISTI • DENTISTS’ ASSOCIATION OF DODECANESE FREE TESTS IN THE DODECANESE • DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION OF MOLOS-PAROS, TRANSPORT OF MAMOGRAPHY DEVICE FOR FREE TESTS • GENERAL HOSPITAL OF KALYMNOS, TRANSPORT OF AMBULANCE • MUNICIPALITY OF SYMI, TRANSPORT OF MEDICINAL MATERIALS • THE SMILE OF THE CHILD The programme of the Attica Group has a long history.

Information to the public National Transplant Organization Since 2013 the Group has supported the National Transplant Organization and has actively aided its important mission, with the goal of widely disseminating the concept of organ donation and transplantation. According to the data of the organization, approximately seven donors per one million of population were recorded in Greece in 2012, a number which is practically at the levels of 2011 (7.2 donors per one million of population) in the context of an action promoted by the Ministry for Health to increase organ donation. Our country ranks among the lowest in Europe in transplantation. According to data for 2013, our country ranks among the lowest positions in terms of organ donation, with only 7 donors per one million of population, while the relevant ﬁgures in other European countries are 20 and more donors. Recognizing the growing need for information and awareness, the Group placed printed information material in the reception area of nine ferries (BLUE STAR 1, BLUE STAR 2, DIAGORAS, BLUE STAR PATMOS, BLUE STAR DELOS, BLUE STAR PAROS, BLUE STAR NAXOS, BLUE STAR ITHAKI and SUPERFAST XII) through which passengers can be informed about organ donation and transplantation. 69 4. Volunteering Blood ties In 2009 we laid the foundation for the commencement of a new, collective volunteering action. The people of Attica Group at land and sea promptly responded to the call for the creation of a special blood bank that will contribute to society and promote the spirit of solidarity, as it will serve the residents of remote islands reached by the company, and also meet extraordinary needs of employees and their families. In cooperation with “G.Gennimatas” General Hospital of Athens, we organized for the 5th consecutive year the volunteer blood donation events which take place twice a year, in May and September, at the Group’s central offices and on-board of ships moored at the port of Piraeus on the relevant days. The warm response from the company’s personnel to calls for blood donation conﬁrms the need for the creation of strong bonds between employees and islanders, developing a fabric of safety and substantial help in emergencies. In 2013, our volunteers managed to collect 90 blood units in total, demonstrating that this initiative has indeed created strong “Blood Ties”, as there have been several emergencies for blood donation. Speciﬁcally, the Blood Bank was created to: • give blood in case of emergency to residents of small remote islands served by the company; • give blood if needed to Group employees and their families; • promote the concept and values of voluntary blood donation and to reinforce the spirit of solidarity of employees working in the ofﬁces, ships, agencies and islands. Below follow the detailed results showing the collected blood units per year: Blood donation data 120 118 100 90 89 80 70 64 60 40 20 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 70 5. Cooperation with Non-Governmental Organizations In 2008, the Group committed to join the efforts of the non-governmental organization “The Smile of the Child”, and placed money boxes on all ships, thus encouraging passengers to contribute to the organization’s major task. More speciﬁcally, in 2013 the amount of €3,839.11 was offered to the Smile of the Child, increasing the total funds raised to date to €21,392.42. Taking into account the remarkable increase in requests for children’s care and the fact that in 2013 the Smile of the Child supported 63,299 children and their families, the Group took further action and collected clothing items which were offered to the organization in December 2013. At the same time, recognizing the important efforts made by numerous other entities and organizations, the Group acknowledges and supports their work by offering free and discount tickets as detailed above. Cooperation with NGOs (€) 6,000.00 5,308.50 5,000.00 4,219.35 4,000.00 3,804.86 3,839.11 3,229.75 3,000.00 2,000.00 1,000.00 991.85 884.00 738.60 733.81 764.10 356.00 0.00 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 The Smile of the Child Medicins du Monde 71 Thank you letters The social role of Attica Group is our bond with the local societies and the residents of islands of the Aegean. By our actions, we have not and do not aim to substitute for the State or regional infrastructure planning. We just wish to be an integral part of the local societies, of the places we travel to every day. We do not want to just be a bystander, who focuses solely on corporate development. This is why, every time a small, simple “thank you note” reaches our ofﬁces from Municipalities, Regions, Associations and Non-Governmental Organizations, it gives us great pleasure and satisfaction, and encourages us to continue our work in the same manner. 72 73 74 75 Communication on Progress (COP) Global Compact Attica Group, within the framework of its Corporate Responsibility Programme, is committed since the beginning of 2009 to the Global Compact of the United Nations, which encourages companies to adopt 10 universally accepted principles for the sustainability of the environment, human rights, labour conditions and the ﬁght against corruption, via universal implementation of the principles in all international activities. The Global Compact is the largest global initiative in corporate responsibility, with thousands of participants from more than 100 countries and its primary goal is to build and promote the social legitimacy of companies and markets. The Global Compact is a purely voluntary global initiative with two primary goals: • That these 10 principles should become the main trend governing business activities all over the world. • That the initiative should act as a catalyst for action in support of the millennium development objectives of the United Nations. Global Compact Principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.

Page 25, 26, 35, 41 77 GRI-G3.1 Indicator Table The Corporate Responsibility Report of Attica Group is based on the Guidelines GRI/G3.1 applied for the composition of sustainability reports. The GRI instructions are a sum of principles and indicators, with a wide range of technical and specialized guidelines, notes and annexes, depending on the sector, which were formed through the international cooperation of multiple interested parties and are evaluated within the composition of these sustainability reports. More speciﬁcally, these reports are based on the GRI Sustainability Report Publication Framework and disclose all conclusions and results extracted during the reporting process concerning the commitments, strategic policy and administrative methods of the organization. The Framework is applied to all organizations, of any size, type or geographical location, and it is already in use as a foundation for the publication of sustainability reports by thousands of international companies, associations and organizations, in all sectors. The Report refers to the period 2013 and records the performance of Attica Group in the sectors of corporate governance, environmental policy, human rights, personnel and society at large. This is the 5th consecutive annual “Social Responsibility Report” issued according to the guidelines of the GRI/G3.1 International Sustainability Reporting Initiative. Electronic database management systems were used for the data collection included at the Report in hand. It is worth mentioning that the methodology used for the calculation of the Report’s indicators remained the same as in the previous years. Finally, it is speciﬁcally stated that the present Report has not yet been certiﬁed by an external, independent body but it is anticipated to be implemented in 2015-2016. 1.1 Statement from the most senior decision maker of the organiCEO’s Address Page 5 zation (e.g., CEO, chair, or equivalent senior position) about the relevance of sustainability to the organization and its strategy. 1.2* Description of key impacts, risks and opportunities.
