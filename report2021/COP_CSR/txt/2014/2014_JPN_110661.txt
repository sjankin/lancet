We, Fuji Electric, pledge as responsible corporate citizens in a global society to strengthen our trust with stakeholders. Our basic philosophy is to apply ourselves earnestly in carrying out our mission. Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, significant changes have been made in the way energy is used in Japan. We have seen the proactive introduction of renewable energy and reforms to the electric power system aimed at providing a stable supply of electricity. On the other hand, emerging countries, especially in Asia, are beginning to experience energy shortages with their ongoing rapid economic growth. These countries are hurrying to implement measures to increase the supply and quality of their electric power, and to use energy more efficiently and reduce their environmental impact. Our mission is to contribute the realization of a safe, secure and sustainable society through energy-related businesses that make full use of the electrical and thermal energy technologies we have developed over the 90 years since our founding. I strongly sense that our capabilities are valued and needed by society today more than ever. Fiscal 2013 Marked a Major Turning Point in Our Management Direction as a “New Base Year for Aggressive Management” As the business restructuring implemented through fiscal 2012 had progressed to a certain point, we designated fiscal 2013 as a “new base year for aggressive management.” In July 2013, we formulated the FY2015 Medium-Term Management Plan, and during the fiscal year we worked to establish a Michihiro Kitazawa growth foundation and to strengthen profitability. President and Representative Director On a consolidated basis, net sales increased Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. ¥14.1 billion year on year to ¥759.9 billion, while operating income grew ¥11.1 billion year on year to ¥33.1 billion. The improvement in operating income was mainly attributable to thorough cost cuts and Fuji Electric Report 2014 Page 06 To Our Stakeholders expense reductions achieved through the “Pro-7 facility in Thailand and commenced production of Activities” to improve profits, as well as the benefits of inverters and uninterruptible power supply systems. the business restructuring carried out in the power Furthermore, in China, we established joint ventures semiconductors and drive businesses in fiscal 2012. in the area of medium-voltage inverters with stateowned Shanghai Electric Group Co., Ltd.

We were awarded a contract from Tokyo Electric Power Company, Incorporated to provide the company with smart meters, which are a vital ­element for creating smart communities that use energy efficiently. To support this new demand, we made a capital investment in an automated production line at our subsidiary GE Fuji Meter Co., Ltd.’s Azumino Factory. In the food and beverage distribution business, we leveraged our thermal energy technologies to develop a next-generation portable cold storage container with the objective of increasing safety and reliability. We will work to increase the market penetration of this product by presenting it to a variety of industries, in particular the food and beverage industry, as a product that will help raise the quality of temperature control. Meanwhile, in Asia, we bolstered our base in both the industrial infrastructure and the power electronics businesses in order to capitalize on the demand for stable electric power supply and quality improvement, thereby expanding our business in this region. In order to accomplish our goal of continued Pro-7 Activities are a company-wide initiative to improve growth in Asia, we established Fuji Tusco Co., Ltd. operating performance.

Case Example Research to Analyze Atmospheric Pollutant PM2.5 and Other Fine Particles Voice A Message from the Development Partner PM2.5 are fine particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in particle diameter, believed to significantly impact both health and climate change. In order to correctly understand these impacts and study solutions, it is first necessary to measure the fine particles in the atmosphere in real time. As such, the development of equipment to perform such an analysis became a pressing issue. In response, we at the University of Tokyo launched a collaborative effort, joining forces with Fuji Electric, which possesses instrumentation technologies, and JAMSTEC (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology), which has its own unique measurement technologies. We were commissioned by the Associate Professor Japan Science and Technology to work on an advanced measurement device development ­program, and Nobuyuki in fiscal 2008, we began joint research towards the development of such a device. Takegawa, (Then) Research Center During the research process, the close industry-academia partnership-based development platform, for Advanced Science and Technology, the in which engineers worked full-time at the university, played a major role in moving the program forward. University of Tokyo In particular, one of the keys to developing the analyzer was a particle trap for capturing particulate (Currently) Professor at the Environment and matter. In our discussions with the engineers, we discovered that we could utilize Fuji Electric’s microGeochemistry Research machining technology, which we had not considered at the beginning. This led to a remarkable Laboratory of the Graduate School of increase in the performance of the equipment. Making use of these various technology synergies, in Science and EngineerMarch 2013, we succeeded in developing a combined aerosol particle analysis technology capable of ing, Tokyo Metropolitan University analyzing the main components of PM2.5 in real time. Going forward, the commercialization of analyzers applying this technology will allow us to shed light on the sources of PM2.5 and establish effective countermeasures for it. Furthermore, this technology will hopefully lead to an overall understanding of the impacts that the various fine particles suspended in the atmosphere have on the earth overall, as well as a general understanding of climate change.
