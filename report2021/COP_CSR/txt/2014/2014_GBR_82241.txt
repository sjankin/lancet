The policy is reviewed annually to ensure its suitability and issued to all stakeholders for their acceptance and commitment to the policy. 2.1.1 Implementation Our company Staff Handbook includes policies regarding equal opportunities, flexible working, parental leave, worklife balance and anti harassment amongst others. All new employees are briefed at induction and given full details on all policies embraced by the company. The Handbook can be viewed at any time by staff. The Head of Compliance manages all policies and procedures and maintains all records in relation to these. Annually all staff are asked to reaffirm their commitment to the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy. In December 2013 the company launched a training academy. The academy aims to: Provide all employees with the capabilities to add real on-going value to Face2Face Contact.  Provide all employees with the inspiration to develop themselves.  Provide all employees with the opportunity to learn new skills and develop existing ones.

In all of our activities we recognise our responsibility to respect the rights of those members of the public we come into contact with. We have a particular focus on effective communication and negotiation and providing information and advice in areas such as legal rights and, where appropriate, health and safety considerations. To this end the company has introduced a Treating Customers Fairly Policy, developing our own principles for achieving fair outcomes for our customers. A suggestion box has been introduced and staff are encouraged to submit ideas through this channel for any business, process, system or environmental improvements. 2.1.2 Measurement All policies are reviewed for suitability, sustainability and effectiveness on an annual basis or sooner should a significant change occur. These reviews are formally recorded. The company has made significant improvements in its management of suppliers and maintains individual assessments on each supplier which includes details of their policies and procedures. These are reviewed annually and a risk score applied dependant on the supplier’s current and future plans in areas of legal and regulatory compliance. In addition to this assessment more formal audits on suppliers will take place during 2014. 2.2 Labour Principles Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation It is the Company’s policy to provide employment, training, promotion, pay, benefits and other conditions of employment without regard to race, colour, ethnic origin, nationality, national origin, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, marital status, age and/or disability unrelated to an individual's ability to perform essential job functions.
