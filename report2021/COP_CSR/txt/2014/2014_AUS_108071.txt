Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 OPERATIONS REPORT Development Fortescue River Gas Pipeline Fortescue is executing a plan to lower energy costs and reduce its carbon footprint by transitioning its Pilbara operations from diesel to natural gas. As a first step, the Fortescue River Gas Pipeline will deliver gas from the Dampier to Bunbury Pipeline to the Solomon Power Station with completion scheduled in the March 2015 quarter. This single initiative will save Fortescue approximately US$20 million a year as well as reducing carbon emissions. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) As an interim step in advance of completion of the natural gas pipeline, Fortescue will truck compressed natural gas (CNG) from facilities in Port Hedland to gas receiving facilities installed at the Solomon Power Station. Deliveries are scheduled to commence in October 2014 and will run until the Fortescue River pipeline is fully commissioned. AP5 Project Fortescue is building a fifth wharf at Anderson Point, AP5, which is scheduled for completion in the March 2015 17 quarter. The fifth berth will provide additional flexibility and efficiency at the port. Solomon Power Station Detrital Processing Plant In May 2014, Fortescue approved the construction of a 5mtpa detrital iron deposit (DID) processing plant at Solomon. The facility will allow DID ore to be processed, eliminating the need for a wet plant addition to the Firetail OPF and freeing the Kings Valley OPF to process Kings CID ore. The project is expected to take just over a year and cost approximately US$105 million. Iron Bridge Project Fortescue is progressing the Iron Bridge magnetite project, 100 kilometres south of Port Hedland. The project, incorporating the North Star and Glacier Valley ore bodies, is being developed in conjunction with Taiwan’s Formosa AP5 construction Group and China’s Baosteel Group. By the end of FY14 the main construction camp was complete, access roads and earthworks at the North Star OPF were nearing completion and pre-strip activities were progressing. First production from the 1.5mtpa Stage 1 is expected in the March 2015 quarter. Exploration Fortescue’s FY14 drilling program focused on identifying and defining new targets for bedded mineralisation in and around the existing Chichester and Solomon hubs.

Peripheral Inferred mineralisation contained in the prior estimate has been re-assessed based on the improved understanding of the mineralisation controls and continuity. As a result, the tonnage of low mass recovery, Inferred mineralisation in the hangingwall and footwall has been reduced with a corresponding significant increase in Mass Recovery. The Glacier Valley estimate was also updated using the available data, including the improved understanding of mineralisation continuity and controls. The 2014 Glacier Valley estimate remains wholly Inferred, with the tonnage increased by 24 per cent, at a better Mass Recovery (2013 Mass Recovery based on MagSus correlation).

A Great Day is when everyone goes home the way they came, having worked safely, hit targets, cared for the environment and kept to schedule. The premise of the program is that if we can have just one Great Day, then there is no reason why we cannot have all Great Days. As an added incentive, the program links to our community investment work and for each Great Day achieved, Fortescue donates funds on a sliding scale to the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) for the essential role they play in saving lives at remote and rural locations such as ours. The more consecutive Great Days we have, the larger our contribution. To date we have donated more than $70,000 and in August last year we presented a cheque for over $40,000 to Nick Harvey from the RFDS at a ceremony at Solomon. Paul Randell, Solomon’s HSE Manager, said the Great Days Program not only made the sites focus on their targets but it enabled them to donate important funds to the RFDS. “The cheque represented the hard work of our employees and contractors at our Christmas Creek and Solomon sites. It is a fantastic effort and I hope that we can continue to work hard to have many more Great Days,” Paul said.

The system is designed to address risk associated with vehicle interaction and lower the risk profile. Hierarchy Road Rules assign right of way priority to different classes of vehicles to reduce the risk associated with vehicle crossings or blind spots. The proposal for vehicle segregation focuses on eliminating a significant portion of vehicle interaction in the mining area. The program was recognised as a finalist in the Safety and Health Innovation Awards 2014 by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia. Cloudbreak vehicle segregation is improving safety 32 CASE STUDIES Occupational Hygiene Program Fortescue has developed an occupational hygiene program to properly manage occupational health risks associated with potential exposure to a variety of health hazards. These hazards include atmospheric contaminants such as dusts, fibres and fumes. The program is designed to effectively anticipate, recognise, evaluate, communicate and control potential health hazards in the workplace in order to prevent occupational illness and disease. Risk based atmospheric contaminant monitoring was conducted across Fortescue operations throughout FY14. Monitoring results are compared against regulated exposure standards and internal action limits to quantify exposures and assess control effectiveness. Across three operational mine sites, over 90 per cent of all monitoring results received were below action levels showing highly controlled work areas for atmospheric contaminant exposure. Ventilation controls are routinely inspected throughout the year to ensure their effectiveness thus providing a safe working environment for our employees.

Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Development T155 expansion The official opening of the Kings Valley project in March 2014 marked the completion of the expansion to 155mtpa. The project was announced in November 2010 and has delivered: • Three advanced OPFs with wet processing capability • Four new crushing hubs • Over 250km of new rail track • 300km of new roads • 50km of conveyor systems • Two new berths • Two new train unloaders with associated stock yard expansion at Herb Elliott Port • Two new aerodromes • Highly automated rail ore car refurbishment facility • A new power station at Solomon and expansion of power generation capacity at the Chichester Hub • Extensive new fuel receiving and delivering facilities 86 • New rail rolling stock and locomotives • Operations villages at Christmas Creek and Solomon 2011 Wharf expansion • Significant expansion of the mobile mining fleet The expansion has been completed for US$9.2 billion or US$92 per tonne. All components of the Port, Rail, Chichester Hub and Solomon Hub expansions have been ramped up and are operating at full capacity. Fortescue River gas pipeline Fortescue is executing a plan to lower energy costs and reduce its carbon footprint by transitioning its Pilbara operations from diesel to natural gas. As a first step, the Fortescue River gas pipeline will deliver gas from the Dampier to Perth Pipeline to the Solomon Power Station with completion scheduled in the March 2015 quarter. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) 2013 Fortescue employees at Kings Valley project As an interim step in advance of completion of the natural gas pipeline, Fortescue will truck compressed natural gas (CNG) from facilities in Port Hedland to gas receiving facilities installed at the Solomon Power Station. Deliveries are scheduled to commence in August 2014 and will run until the Fortescue River pipeline is fully commissioned. AP5 Project The project to build the fifth wharf at Anderson Point, AP5, remains on schedule and on budget for completion in the March 2015 quarter. Dredging was completed in the June 2014 quarter and installation of wharf piles has commenced. All major contracts have been awarded and fabrications of wharf modules are under way in China and Western Australia. Train load-out module being delivered to Solomon Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Detrital Processing Plant Construction of a 5mtpa detrital processing plant at Solomon will allow processing of detrital ore, eliminating the need for an expensive wet plant addition to the Firetail OPF. Project duration is estimated at 55 weeks at a cost of approximately US$105 million. Iron Bridge Project Construction activities continue to achieve planned milestones for Stage 1 of the Iron Bridge magnetite project. The main construction camp is complete, access roads and earthworks at the Northstar OPF are nearing completion and pre-strip activities are progressing. Concrete works at the OPF are well advanced with commencement of structural, mechanical and piping works. A contract has been awarded for the electrical and instrumentation package of works. First production from the 1.5mtpa OPF is expected in the March 2015 quarter. Incremental Train Control System (ITCS) ITCS has been implemented across Fortescue’s rail system and is now fully operational. The system is delivering improvements in train scheduling, operations and optimisation of the network. 87 Autonomous Haulage System 2014 Port AP5 expansion The trial of autonomous trucks at Solomon has demonstrated that the technology is suitable for deployment across the Firetail and Kings Valley projects. Ship construction During the financial year Fortescue entered into arrangements for the construction of four highly efficient very large ore carriers (VLOCs) for a total investment value of US$275 million. The vessels are scheduled for delivery from November 2016 to May 2017 with the majority of payments due upon delivery. The 260,000 dead weight tonnage class vessels are larger than the traditional capsize vessels that have dominated the seaborne market and incorporate design specifications Incremental Train Control System ideally suited to Port Hedland’s tidal conditions. The VLOCs design complements the port infrastructure and will improve load rates, efficiencies and reduce operating costs at Port. Further savings will be derived as the expected cost of operating these vessels is well below the current forward market rates for large capsize vessels. In July 2014 Fortescue secured construction of four additional iron ore carriers to be delivered in late 2017 to early 2018, for a total investment value of US$280 million.

Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Strategy As Fortescue has completed its major expansion program, the focus has shifted to consolidation of the operations and maximising the output from the Company’s world class assets. Whilst each component of the mine, rail and port operations have been running consistently at the target capacity over the June 2014 quarter, focus continues on ways to optimise operations to deliver additional low cost tonnes from the existing assets base. From an operational stance Fortescue’s key priority is the identification of additional efficiencies and driving the costs down further. In FY15 Fortescue expects to deliver total shipments of 155 to 160 million tonnes at C1 operating costs of US$31/wmt to US$32/wmt, a 30 per cent cost reduction over a two year period. Key drivers for the savings in FY15 will be a full year of production out of Kings Valley, improved processing capability, and operational efficiencies and innovations. The construction of VLOCs, scheduled for completion in 2017 – 2018, will further add to the reduction of total delivered costs as the vessels are ideally designed for our Port operations and the expected 94 cost of operating the vessels is below the current forward market rates for large capsize vessels. Isak Buitendag, Director Health, Safety and Security Fortescue continues to evolve its product strategy, including a successful launch of Fortescue Blend in FY14, a high quality product that maximises the benefits of low impurity Chichester and higher iron content Firetail product. In July 2014, Fortescue introduced its new low alumina, 58 per cent iron grade Kings CID product, which further complements Fortescue’s product offering of high value-in-use iron ore fines. Fortescue is committed to driving down its gearing to the initial target of 40 per cent. In order to achieve this gearing target, a further debt repayment of US$2.0 billion to US$2.5 billion is required, which is expected to be executed over the next 18 to 24 months. The exact timing of these repayments will depend on a number of factors, including iron ore prices and the Australian dollar exchange rate. Reclaimer at Port Hedland Once the gearing target of 40 per cent is achieved, Fortescue is planning to move to a 30 to 40 per cent dividend payout ratio. Fortescue continues to strategically evaluate incremental growth opportunities, with a number of projects increasing output with minimal capex underway. These include the design and construction of a five million tonne per annum wet processing plant, providing a lower cost and more efficient solution for the detritals product out of Kings.

The Board takes seriously the need for continuous monitoring of environmental matters and compliance with environmental regulations. Fortescue’s exploration, mining, rail and port activities are subject to various environmental regulations under both State and Commonwealth legislation. Fortescue manages compliance with its environmental responsibilities and sets its objectives and targets through its Environmental Management System. Fortescue identifies risks of environmental impact from its projects and operations and sets improvement plans for the highest environmental risks. Fortescue measures its environmental performance against its regulatory requirements and corporate targets. Fortescue’s environmental performance is reported to a hierarchy of management. As a part of the Environmental Management System, Fortescue also conducts internal environmental reviews, audits and inspections to identify and quantify potential 95 risks to Fortescue and to review compliance with its environmental obligations. The fundamental aim of each Fortescue Marshes activity is to minimise or prevent adverse environmental consequences and to promote a culture of compliance. Fortescue strives to continually improve its environmental performance by a systematic review of its environmental risks. During the financial year, certain aspects of the Fortescue’s operations were routinely inspected by the Department of Environment Regulation (DER) (previously the Department of Environment and Conservation) and the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (DSEWPC). Work continued to resolve a number of potential non-compliances relating to works approvals and licences identified and reported to the DER in 2012. During the financial year, Fortescue has submitted Ring tailed dragon numerous environmental reports and statements to regulators detailing Fortescue’s environmental performance and level of compliance with relevant instruments. This includes Fortescue’s Compliance Assessment Reports dated March 2014, which were provided to the Office of the Environmental Protection Authority, and the Annual Environmental Reports submitted to the Department of Mines and Petroleum and the Department of State Development. Mulgara Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Greenhouse gas and energy reporting Fortescue complies with the Australian government National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth) and the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act 2006 (Cth). Fortescue is committed to proactively managing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions wherever practical and is guided by a formal internal policy. The total Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions for the most recent reporting period were 1.85 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. Fortescue’s greenhouse emissions are almost entirely related to combustion of diesel fuel and, therefore, the Company was not considered a liable entity under the Clean Energy Legislation carbon scheme.

Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT The Directors of Fortescue Metals Group Limited are pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2014 (‘FY2014 or FY14’). This report forms part of the Directors’ Report and has been audited in accordance with section 308 (3c) of the Corporations Act 2001. The report is outlined in the following sections: a) Who this report covers 99 b) FY2014 overview and year ahead 100 c) Governance of our remuneration 102 d) Executive remuneration strategy 104 e) Executive remuneration structure 105 f ) Key components of Executive remuneration 106 g) How Fortescue performed over the past five years 110 98 h) Securities trading policy 111 i) Executive contract terms 111 j) Detailed remuneration for Executives 112 k) Non-Executive Director remuneration 116 l) Equity Instrument disclosures relating to key management personnel 117 Whilst the functional and reporting currency of Fortescue is US dollars, it is the Directors’ view that presentation of the information in Australian dollars provides a more accurate and fair reflection of the remuneration practices of Fortescue, as all Directors, Executives and Employees are remunerated in Australian dollars. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT a) Who this report covers This report outlines the remuneration arrangements for Fortescue’s Key Management Personnel (KMP). KMP are defined as ‘those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity’. The KMP of the Group for FY14 were: Non-executive Directors A Forrest Chairman H Elliott Deputy Chairman M Barnaba Non-Executive Director G Brayshaw Non-Executive Director (retired 13 November 2013) E Gaines Non-Executive Director O Hegarty Non-Executive Director C Huiquan Non-Executive Director G Raby Non-Executive Director G Rowley Non-Executive Director H Scruggs Non-Executive Director S Warburton Non-Executive Director (appointed 13 November 2013) 99 Executive Directors N Power Chief Executive Officer P Meurs Director Development Other key management personnel (executives) N Cernotta Director Operations (appointed 24 March 2014) S Pearce Chief Financial Officer D Woodall Director Operations (resigned 12 December 2013) There were no changes to Key Management Personnel after the reporting date. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT b) FY14 overview and year ahead Fortescue’s remuneration strategy seeks to build a performance orientated culture by attracting and retaining the best possible people to align with driving increased shareholder value. Fortescue’s Board and Remuneration and Nomination Committee (R&NC) are committed to continued review and refinement of the remuneration strategy to ensure it meets the changing needs of the organisation, maintains market competitiveness, and aligns to shareholder interests. In support of the remuneration strategy, the following table highlights key changes made in FY14: Key Area Description Approach to Safety Measure in the event of a fatality In the event of a fatality, ESSIP participants (Group Managers, General Managers and Executive) will receive no award for the Company Safety KPI and all staff at the location where the fatality occurs will receive no award against Company or Team Safety KPIs. FY14 Remuneration Outcomes Linking Performance and Pay The following explains how fixed and variable remuneration outcomes were driven by company performance in FY14. 100 Element of Remuneration Outcome Total Fixed Remuneration (TFR) A market review was conducted for the CEO which resulted in an increase in total fixed remuneration to $2,000,000 (11.1 per cent) effective from 1 July 2014. Prior to this review the CEO’s fixed remuneration had not increased since February 2011.  A market review was conducted which identified that Executive total fixed remuneration has fallen below competitive levels. Accordingly, the Board made a decision to increase fixed remuneration for Executives (on average) by 3.3 per cent to re-align with the market and increase retention opportunity. Prior to this review, fixed remuneration for Executives had not increased since July 2011. Executive and Senior Staff Incentive Plan (ESSIP) Awards made in relation to the FY14 ESSIP reflect the achievement of one of the three company performance objectives delivering a significant reduction in C1 costs, the achievement of Company growth objectives and individual performance objectives. Although the TRIFR measure was met, no award was made in respect to this measure as detailed in the FY14 changes above. Refer to section (f ) for more detail. The outcome represents an average payment of 76 per cent of maximum opportunity compared with an average payment of 78 per cent of maximum opportunity in FY13. Long Term Incentive Plan (LTI) LTI grants were made in December 2013 in respect to the FY14 LTI plan. The performance period for the FY14 LTI is 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2016 and award outcomes for the FY14 LTI plan will be reported in the 2016 remuneration report. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Total Earnings in FY14 Details of remuneration received by the Chief Executive Officer and Executives prepared in accordance with statutory requirements and accounting standards are detailed on page 112. The table below sets out the total earnings for the Chief Executive Officer and Executives realised in FY14 – sometimes referred to as ‘actual’ pay. The table includes fixed remuneration, the cash component of the ESSIP earnings for FY14 performance and the value of the share component of the FY14 ESSIP that vested. FY14 ESSIP4 Total Actual Fixed FY14 ESSIP Shares Remuneration Name remuneration1 Cash Paid Awarded Earned in 2014 N Power 1,800,000 2,072,780 3,872,780 S Pearce 1,050,000 957,043 2,007,043 P Meurs 1,050,000 872,335 1,922,335 N Cernotta2 261,941 57,721 82,784 402,446 D Woodall3 410,017 410,017 1 Fixed remuneration includes cash salary, paid leave and superannuation. 2 Mr Cernotta was appointed on 24 March 2014. 3 Mr Woodall resigned on 12 December 2013. 4 The actual share value to the individual is not realised until the shares are awarded. For the purpose of this report the nominal ESSIP share value for FY14 is the value of the participant’s elected weighting in shares (minimum 50 per cent of the total award) divided by the VWAP of Fortescue Shares for the first five trading days of the plan year (A$3.1653) 101 multiplied by the 5 day VWAP of Fortescue shares for the first five trading days of FY15 ($4.5397). Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT c) Governance of our remuneration At Fortescue, we believe that robust governance is critical to underpinning the effectiveness of our remuneration strategy. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee operates under a Board-approved charter. This includes responsibility for reviewing and reporting to the Board on Executive remuneration policy and practices such as remuneration levels and incentive plans. It also includes recruitment, retention, performance management, succession planning and termination policies and managing Board nomination, including determining candidate criteria and addressing skills and experience requirements for Board position vacancies. A copy of the charter is available under the Corporate Governance section of the Fortescue Website. The R&NC in FY14 consisted solely of Non-Executive Directors. The Chief Executive Officer and others may be invited to attend meetings by the Committee Chair as required, but have no vote on matters before the Committee. The process and accountabilities in determining remuneration are shown below: Remuneration Board of Directors consultants Responsible for: May be engaged • Approving the remuneration of non-executive directors 102 directly by and the CEO the Board or • Ensuring remuneration practices are competitive and align Remuneration with the attraction and retention policies of the Company and Nomination Committee to provide advice or information Remuneration and Nomination Committee relating to KMP Advises the Board on: that is free from influence of • Remuneration policies and practices management. • Non-executive director remuneration • Executive remuneration Human Resources Management Remuneration Responsible for: consultants • Implementation of remuneration policies and practices Will be engaged • Advising the Remuneration and Nomination Committee directly by of changing statutory market conditions management • Provides relevant information to the Remuneration and other than in Nomination Committee to assist with decisions respect of KMPs to provide advice and market data to ensure Fortescue’s remuneration position remains competitive. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT Use of remuneration consultants During the year, Egan Associates provided external remuneration advice to the R&NC. During FY14, Egan Associates provided remuneration recommendations (as defined in the Corporations Act 2001) relating to a review of the structure for KMP remuneration. The remuneration recommendations were provided to the R&NC as an input into decision making only. The R&NC considered the recommendations, along with other factors, in making its remuneration decisions. The total fee was paid for the remuneration recommendations was A$17,500 (ex GST). Other services provided by Egan Associates included other advisory services and the fees for all other services were A$8,645 (ex GST). The following arrangements were made to ensure that the advice was free of undue influence by members of the KMP: • Egan Associates was engaged by the Chair of the R&NC of the Board • Fortescue Management were not involved in the formulation of any remuneration recommendations, but provided factual information to assist Egan Associates • Egan Associates provided the remuneration recommendation only to the Chair of the R&NC. Due to the implementation of these measures, the Board and R&NC are satisfied that the advice provided was free from undue influence from members of Fortescue’s KMP and Egan Associates have provided a written statement to this effect. 103 Clawback Policy Fortescue operates a Clawback Policy. Clawback will be initiated where in the opinion of the Board: 1) an Award, which would not have otherwise vested, vests or may vest as a result directly or indirectly of: a) the fraud, dishonesty or breach of obligations (including, without limitation, a material misstatement of financial information) of any person; or b) any other action or omission (whether intentional or inadvertent) of any person, the Board may make a determination to ensure that no unfair benefit is obtained by any Participant; or 2) an Award, which may otherwise have vested, has not vested as a result directly or indirectly of any circumstance referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) or (b) above, the Board may reconsider the level of satisfaction of the applicable Conditions and reinstate and vest any Award that may have lapsed to the extent that the Board determines appropriate in the circumstances. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT d) Executive remuneration strategy Fortescue’s reward strategy seeks to build a performance orientated culture that supports the achievement of our strategic vision and to attract, retain and motivate its employees by providing market competitive fixed remuneration and incentives. The reward strategy also supports Fortescue’s extraordinary growth and progression as one of the world’s leading producers of iron ore through: • being well positioned to deliver fair and market competitive rewards; • supporting a clear performance focus; and • alignment to the long term goals of the organisation. Fortescue is committed to providing competitive remuneration packages to our Executives and senior employees. Fortescue benchmarks remuneration components against major indices such as ASX 100 Resources and ASX 30 and also seeks input from independent remuneration consultants regarding Executive remuneration as detailed in section (c) above. The overall intent is to ensure that executive remuneration is appropriately positioned to motivate, attract and retain key Executives and senior employees to deliver on the current and long term strategic activities of the Company. How remuneration practices align with our reward strategy 104 Remuneration strategy principle Purpose Practice A minimum 50 per cent of the ESSIP High levels Drive alignment of employee paid in shares with Executives able of share ownership and shareholder interests to elect up to 100 per cent in shares.

The key components of the executive remuneration structure for FY14 comprised: • Total Fixed Remuneration (TFR); • Executive & Senior Staff Incentive Plan (ESSIP); and • Long Term Incentive Plan (LTI). Remuneration may also include participation in the Salary Sacrifice Share Plan (SSSP). Total remuneration comprising each of these components is benchmarked against the market taking into account the Company’s position as the world’s fourth largest iron ore producer and explorer and its ranking in the top thirty listed Australian companies. Remuneration is benchmarked against companies in the ASX 100 Resources Index, with total remuneration targeted at the third quartile. Total reward opportunities are intended to provide Executives the opportunity to earn 75th percentile rewards for outstanding performance against stretch targets. Information provided by Egan Associates revealed that current total remuneration levels are generally consistent with this policy. Remuneration Mix 105 The table below shows the remuneration mix for performance at stretch for the CEO and Direct Reports in FY14: CEO 28% 31% 41% Direct Reports 36% 28% 36% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% TFR ESSIP (at risk) LTI (at risk) * Note the table above represents the remuneration mix for stretch levels of performance for the CEO and CEO Direct Reports in FY14 and does not take into consideration options granted to Mr Peter Meurs at the start of his employment or any value that may be attributed to the guarantee provided by the Minderoo Group which supported certain senior executives in purchasing Fortescue shares on-market. The above table clearly illustrates the significant proportion of ‘at-risk’ components of executive remuneration and serves to reinforce the pay-for-performance alignment. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT f) Key components of Executive remuneration Total Fixed Remuneration TFR comprises base salary, cash allowances (such as site-based or location allowances), employee benefits and superannuation. The level of TFR is based on the Executive’s responsibilities, experience and qualifications. Company and individual performance are considered during the annual remuneration review process. Executive and Senior Staff Incentive Plan The purpose of the ESSIP is to incentivise and reward key Fortescue Executives (including KMP) for achieving Company and individual performance objectives that drive shareholder value. An Executive’s ESSIP potential award is linked 50 per cent to Company objectives, and 50 per cent to individual performance, aligning Executive remuneration with Company performance during the Plan Year. A maximum incentive opportunity is established at the beginning of the financial year for each Executive. The incentive is delivered as a minimum of 50 per cent in ordinary shares, and a maximum of 50 per cent in cash. The plan allows participants to elect to receive up to 100 per cent of the incentive in shares. Share rights are granted based on the election made by the participant and represent the maximum number of shares that may be awarded subject to performance. Shares rights are calculated based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of Fortescue shares traded over the first five trading days of the plan year (eg. 1 July 2013 to 5 July 2013). The maximum incentive opportunity for KMPs in FY14 is shown below: 106 Chief Executive Officer 112.5 per cent of TFR* 1 participant Direct Reports 75 per cent of TFR* 3 participants * Note that the actual award outcomes under the ESSIP will be determined by the number of objectives achieved and the value of the Fortescue shares at time of vesting. Individuals who leave during the year (i.e. before 30 June) are not eligible to receive an ESSIP award, unless by specific R&NC approval. On receipt of such approval, the ESSIP is pro-rated based on service during the period, and made at the usual payment date, which is around September of each year, post release of audited and approved full year results. Individuals who commence during the year similarly will have awards under the ESSIP pro-rated based on service during the performance period. ESSIP performance objectives ESSIP awards are made based on an assessment of Company and individual performance. Company performance comprises company annual performance and company growth performance, and is designed to provide both a short and long term perspective on performance, and protect the long term interests of the shareholder by seeking to ensure efficient processing of reserves mined and that financial objectives are met. The financial performance measures were chosen as they represent the key drivers for the short term success of the Company and provide a framework for delivering long term value. The non-financial component of the ESSIP is measured with reference to an assessment against a range of measures. A majority of the non-financial measures are quantitative-based. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT The performance objectives in 2014 are shown below: FY14 Results CEO Direct Reports Weighting Outcome Weighting Outcome Company Annual Performance Safety2 Target percentage reduction (15 per cent) in Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) Met* 15 0 8 0 Production2 Target tonnes shipped Not Met 15 0 8 0 Cost1 Target cost per tonne shipped Met 15 16.43 8 8.73 Company Growth Performance Culture2 Achieve agreed workforce culture and engagement targets Met 15 15 0 n/a Growth2 Identify and independently verify additional target expansion opportunities by 30 June 2014 Met 10 10 8 8 Financial1 Achieve target annual Absolute Return on Equity (AROE) of >20% Met 10 10 10 10 Financial1 Achieve Target free cash flow Met 10 10 0 n/a Physical2 Target percentage of reserves mined is converted (after processing losses) to product, inclusive of quality measurement (e.g. grade 107 expectations and real mined tonnage) Met 10 10 8 8 Individual Performance 4 objectives based on the business plan Avg weighted according to business impact Partially Met 0 0 50 37.5 1 Financial Targets. 2 Non-Financial Targets. 3 A key element of our culture is to set challenging stretch targets and strive to outperform those targets. In the 2014 year we set ourselves a number of key targets in respect of cost reduction across all operating and support functions. These cost reduction targets are a high priority for the Board and they have approved an above target award to reflect the degree of outperformance by the business in this area. This is contrasted with the production measure where the business fell marginally short of the stretch target and received no award for this element. * Although the TRIFR measure was achieved in FY14, as a result of the two fatalities during the year, ESSIP participants (Group Managers, General Managers and Executive) will receive no award for the Company Safety KPI and all staff at the location where the fatalities occurred will receive no award against Company or Team Safety KPIs. In FY14, the CEO was measured solely against Company performance outcomes thereby ensuring the alignment between Company performance, shareholder returns and CEO reward for the performance year. Payment of ESSIP awards are made in September after the release of the Company’s audited results and with final approval from the Board. How Objectives and Weightings are Determined ESSIP targets and measures are set on an annual basis and are linked to the annual stretch budget and Fortescue’s strategic plan. Personal objectives are set at stretch levels of performance with measures and weightings aligned to the individual’s ability to influence outcomes and ensure focus on critical outcomes. The following table shows the relationship between the primary ESSIP performance measures for the CEO and other KMP.

How the ESSIP works: an example The ESSIP is designed so that participants are generally rewarded similarly to a Fortescue investor over the financial year. Example: The example below assumes that Executive A has an incentive opportunity of $100,000 and has elected to take 70 per cent of the incentive in shares. Details of offer Nominal Value of full award $100,000 VWAP at start of FY14 (1 to 5 July 2013) $3.1653 Participant Share Weighting 70% Maximum potential award Cash (30 per cent of opportunity) $30,000 Share Rights (70 per cent of opportunity) 22,115 Example outcome Percentage of incentive opportunity achieved (company and personal performance) 80% Cash paid (80 per cent of cash component) $24,000 Shares awarded (80 per cent of share rights convert to ordinary shares) 17,692 The actual value of the shares awarded is subject to share price movement thereby ensuring alignment with shareholder interests. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT ESSIP performance in FY14 Performance rights granted under the ESSIP at the beginning of FY14 are shown below. All the performance rights issued convert to ordinary shares if all ESSIP objectives are met. The last column details the actual number of share rights converted to ordinary shares based on actual performance: ESSIP Performance rights ESSIP ESSIP performance to convert performance performance rights to shares for FY14 Executive rights issued rights lapsed forfeited ESSIP performance N Power 639,750 183,160 456,590 S Pearce 248,792 37,976 210,816 P Meurs 248,792 56,635 192,157 N Cernotta 30,527 12,291 18,236 D Woodall 106,625 (106,625) Unvested share rights lapse once the outcome of the ESSIP is determined.

For the purpose of this report the nominal ESSIP share value for FY14 is the number of shares awarded multiplied by the five day VWAP of Fortescue shares traded over the first five trading days of FY15 (A$4.5397). 3 Mr Cernotta was appointed on 24 March 2014. Long Term Incentive Plan LTI awards to executives are made under the performance share plan rules and are delivered in the form of Performance Rights (Rights). Each Right entitles the holder (subject to achievement of the specified performance conditions) to one fully paid ordinary share in the Company for nil consideration. The Company uses absolute return on equity (AROE) as the performance measure for assessments of LTI awards. AROE was selected as the LTI performance measure for the following reasons: • AROE is one of the most important value metrics reflecting profit earned relative to shareholders equity (the amount of capital invested by shareholders); and • AROE performance in excess of the Company’s cost of equity capital will deliver shareholder value. As with the ESSIP above, the long term incentive plan is designed so that participants are generally rewarded similarly to a Fortescue investor over the relevant performance period. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT A minimum 20 per cent annual AROE hurdle rate was selected for the following reasons: • 20 per cent exceeds the Company’s cost of equity; • The average AROE for the ASX 100 Resources Index from 2009 to 2013 is 8.5 per cent; • The 80th percentile AROE for the ASX 100 Resources Index from 2009 to 2013 is 15 per cent. The vesting schedule is as follows: Average AROE Performance FY 13 FY 14 Vesting Below Threshold <15% <20% Nil Threshold 15% 20% 25 per cent of share rights vest Target 30+% 30+% 100 per cent of share rights vest Vesting between threshold and target is calculated linearly. The performance period for the FY14 LTI is from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2016. Share Rights will convert to shares at the end of the three year performance period subject to performance against the AROE performance measure. The average AROE over three years will be measured as the sum of AROE for years 1, 2 and 3 divided by 3. Average AROE less than Threshold Performance will result in no award. 110 In the event of a change of control of the Company, the performance period end date will generally be brought forward to the date of the change of control and awards will vest over this shortened period, subject to ultimate Board discretion. The Clawback Policy also applies to this plan. Salary Sacrifice Share Plan Executives may nominate an amount (up to A$5,000 per annum) of pre-tax salary to acquire ordinary shares under the SSSP. Provided ordinary shares are kept in the SSSP, income tax on the acquisition of these ordinary shares can be deferred by the Executive for up to seven years. Disposal restrictions apply while the shares remain in the SSSP. Shares acquired under this plan are not subject to performance conditions because they are issued in lieu of salary which would otherwise be payable and are subject to a monetary limit of A$5,000 per annum. g) How Fortescue performed over the past five years Fortescue continues to build on its performance over the past five years, showing strong growth in revenue and net profit to deliver shareholder wealth. In considering Fortescue’s performance and benefits for shareholder wealth, the Board have regard to the following indices in respect of the current financial year and the previous four financial years. In FY14, Fortescue’s share price increased from the FY13 closing price of A$3.04 to A$4.35 at the end of FY14. This represents a 43 per cent increase compared with the ASX 100 Resources index which increased 14.2 per cent over the corresponding period. 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Revenue from iron ore operations – US$millon 11,611 8,057 6,681 5,442 3,220 Net profit – US$million 2,740 1,746 1,559 1,022 581 A$ dividends paid $0.20 $0.10 $0.08 $0.03 A$ change in share price $1.31 $(1.81) $(1.45) $2.23 $0.43 per cent change in share price 43 (37) (23) 54 12 An explanation of how fixed and variable remuneration outcomes were driven by company performance in FY14 is included in section (b).

The CEO and Executives are employed on a rolling basis with no specified fixed term. The CEO and Executives are remunerated on a total fixed remuneration (TFR) basis inclusive of superannuation and allowances. The major terms of the agreements relating to remuneration are set out in the table below: 111 Maximum Maximum ESSIP LTIP TFR* opportunity opportunity Position Executive (A$) (per cent of TFR) (per cent of TFR) Termination clause Chief Executive Officer N Power 1,800,000 112.5 150 Three months written notice (or three months TFR in lieu) Chief Financial Officer S Pearce 1,050,000 75 100 Three months written notice (or three months TFR in lieu) Director Development P Meurs 1,050,000 75 100 Three months written notice (or three months TFR in lieu) Director Operations N Cernotta 950,000 75 100 Three months written notice (or three months TFR in lieu) * Total Fixed Remuneration as of 30 June 2014. Reviewed annually by the R&NC. All Executives are required to provide written notice of three months to terminate their service agreement. Should Executives not provide sufficient notice they will forfeit the monetary equivalent (calculated based on TFR) of any shortfall in the notice period. If an Executive resigns and leaves the Company prior to 30 June in any year, the Executive will forfeit all entitlement to any award under the ESSIP. If an Executive retires, is made redundant or leaves the Company as a result of a negotiated termination, the R&NC Committee at its sole discretion may elect to make a pro-rata ESSIP payment based on service up to the termination date. If the Executive resigns and leaves the Company prior to 30 June in the year of vesting under the LTI, the Executive will forfeit all entitlement to any award under the LTI. If an Executive retires, is made redundant or leaves the Company as a result of a negotiated termination prior to 30 June in the year of vesting under the LTI, the R&NC Committee at its sole discretion may elect to make a pro-rata LTI award based on service up to the termination date. Termination benefits for KMP comply with the limits set by the Corporations Act that do not require shareholder approval.

Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT Share-based remuneration Options over equity instruments granted as remuneration During the year ending 30 June 2012, the Board of Fortescue Metals Group Limited consented to The Minderoo Group Pty Ltd (formerly the Metal Group Pty Ltd), an entity controlled by the Chairman, to offer an arrangement to provide financial assistance to allow certain senior executives of Fortescue to purchase the Company’s shares on market. The arrangement was effected through a number of separate transactions and appropriate disclosures made via lodgement of an Appendix 3Y as required by the ASX Listing Rules. The arrangement constitutes a share-based payment transaction and has been measured with reference to the fair value of the benefit received by the executives and is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over a four-year vesting period, in line with the service conditions. The fair value was determined at grant date using Monte-Carlo simulation model. Total share-based payment expense in relation to the arrangement for the financial year ended 30 June 2014 was A$925,453 (2013: A$925,453). The purpose was to provide an opportunity for a limited number of senior individuals critical to Fortescue’s performance to be incentivised and remunerated through increased direct share ownership (reinforcing alignment with shareholder interests), and further enhance Fortescue’s ability to retain these individuals over the long term. The offer is provided at no cost to Fortescue and the Executive is required to arrange their own finance through a third party and is responsible for all repayments and associated costs. Mr Meurs is a participant in the above financial arrangement. Under this arrangement The Minderoo Group Pty Limited provided Mr Meurs with financial assistance by way of a guarantee for the acquisition of 16,632,614 ordinary shares in the Company. The fair value attributed to Mr Meurs in relation to this arrangement for the financial year ended 30 June 2014 114 was A$853,272(2013: A$853,272). There are no current plans to offer this arrangement to any additional employees. Details of share based payments relating to LTI The following table provides details of the number of share rights granted under the LTI during the financial years ended 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2013.

Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT Legacy Incentive Option Scheme (IOS) Details of options over ordinary shares in the Company that were granted under the legacy Incentive Option Scheme (IOS) as remuneration to KMP are set out below. The plan has now been discontinued; however some grants still remain on foot and continue to vest. All options refer to options over ordinary shares of the Company, which are exercisable on a one for one basis under the IOS. Options granted under the plan carry no dividend or voting rights. When exercisable, each option is convertible into one ordinary share. The terms and conditions of each grant of options affecting KMP remuneration in the current or future reporting periods are set out below. The IOS provided eligible employees with options subject to share price performance and time conditions determined by the Board. These awards were typically targeted at KMP at the time of appointment, or to retain selected individuals critical to the Company’s development. The options typically vested in 3 tranches over a 36 month period. When exercisable, each option is convertible into one ordinary share of Fortescue Metals Group Limited. Number of options vested Name 2014 2013 Directors of Fortescue Metals Group Limited Other key management personnel of the Company 115 P Meurs1 937,500 2,187,500 1  Once vested, the options are subject to a further share price performance hurdle before they can be exercised. Half of the options require a share price of $7.00 with the second half requiring a share price of $8.00 before they can be exercised. The options were provided at no cost to the recipients. All options expire on the earlier of their expiry date or termination of the individual’s employment. Once performance hurdles (share price performance and time conditions) are met, the options are exercisable evenly on an annual basis over the four years from grant date. The assessed fair value of options at grant date has been included in the remuneration tables above. The estimated fair value was determined using a trinomial option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date, expected price volatility of the underlying share, the effect of additional market conditions, the expected dividend yield, estimated share conversion factor and the risk free interest rate for the term of the right. There were no amendments to the terms and conditions of options awarded as remuneration since their award date. Exercise of options granted as remuneration No options were exercised by KMP in FY14. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT k) Non-Executive director remuneration Non-Executive director fees are not ‘at-risk’, to reflect the nature of their responsibilities. Non-Executive directors receive fees for both Board and Committee membership. The payment of additional fees for serving on a Committee recognises the additional time commitment required by non-Executive directors who serve on a Committee. The Board Chairman attends all Committee meetings but does not receive any additional fees in addition to Board fees. The maximum aggregate remuneration payable to non-Executive directors is $2.0 million, which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting on 19 November 2010. There have been no changes to the aggregate fee pool since November 2010. The Board will not seek any increase to this fee pool at the 2014 AGM.

As confirmed by Egan Associates, in aggregate, each individual non-Executive directors’ total fees are below the market median for non-Executive directors of similarly sized companies (e.g. companies ranked on the ASX50 or ASX100 Resources). Non-executive directors do not receive retirement benefits, nor do they participate in any incentive programs of the Company.

These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), including Australian Interpretations, and the Corporations Act 2001. (a) Compliance with IFRS The consolidated financial statements of the Group also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. (b) Historical cost convention These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value. (c) Functional and presentation currency The financial statements are presented in United States dollars, which is the Group’s reporting currency and the functional currency of the parent and the majority of its subsidiaries. (d) Critical accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use certain critical accounting estimates and to exercise 129 their judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to these financial statements are: • Income taxes • Iron ore reserve estimates • Exploration and evaluation expenditure • Development expenditure • Property, plant and equipment – recoverable amount • Rehabilitation estimates The accounting estimates and judgements applied to these areas are disclosed in note 36. (e) Rounding of amounts The Company is of a kind referred to in Class order 98/100, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, relating to the “rounding off” of amounts in the financial report. Amounts in the financial report have been rounded off in accordance with that Class Order to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 2 Segment information Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The internal reporting is provided to the chief operating decision maker on a consolidated basis. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above consolidated information. Fortescue uses earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) as a key measure of its financial performance. The reconciliation of EBITDA to the net profit after tax is presented below. 2014 2013 Note US$m US$m EBITDA 5,636 3,575 Finance income 7 21 33 Finance expenses 7 (741) (586) Net gain on refinancing 4 23 Depreciation and amortisation 5,6 (965) (463) Assets write-off 6 (22) (71) Exploration, development and other 6 (16) (45) 130 Net profit before tax 3,913 2,466 Income tax expense 8 (1,173) (720) Net profit after tax 2,740 1,746 (a) Geographical information Fortescue operates predominantly in the geographical location of Australia, and this is the location of the vast majority of the Group’s assets.

For general borrowings, the interest capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings during the period. For the year ended 30 June 2014, the capitalisation rate used for specific borrowings was 6.88 per cent (2013: 6.88 per cent) and 6.90 per cent (2013: 7.09 per cent) for general borrowings. 8 Income tax expense (a) Income tax expense 2014 2013 US$m US$m Current tax 824 136 Deferred tax 349 584 1,173 720 (b) Numerical reconciliation of income tax expense to prima facie tax payable 2014 2013 US$m US$m Profit before income tax 3,913 2,466 Tax at the Australian tax rate of 30 per cent (2013: 30 per cent) 1,174 740 Research and development 9 (20) Adjustments in respect of income tax expense of prior periods 2 (5) Foreign exchange variations and other translation adjustments (11) 9 Tax impact of overseas jurisdiction (9) Share-based payments (1) 2 Net tax outcome of internal restructure 1 Other 9 (7) Income tax expense 1,173 720 Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 8 Income tax expense (continued) (c) Tax consolidation legislation The Company and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation. The accounting policy in relation to this legislation is set out in note 35(g). On adoption of the tax consolidation legislation, the entities in the tax consolidated group entered into a tax sharing agreement which, in the opinion of the directors, limits the joint and several liability of the wholly-owned entities in the case of a default by the head entity, Fortescue Metals Group Limited. The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly-owned entities fully compensate the Company for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by the Company for any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses or unused tax credits that are transferred to the Company under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined by reference to the amounts recognised in the whollyowned entities’ financial statements. The amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding advice from the head entity. The Company may also require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments. The funding amounts are recognised as non-current intercompany receivables or payables. (d) MRRT On 19 March 2012, the Australian Government passed through the Senate, the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012, with application to certain profits arising from the extraction of iron ore and coal in Australia. MRRT is considered to be income 133 tax for Australian accounting purposes, is imposed on a project-by-project basis to upstream operations only and is applied from 1 July 2012. The effective tax rate is 22.5 per cent. At 30 June 2014, the Group had a net deferred tax asset balance of US$4,265 million (2013: US$3,765 million) in relation to MRRT, and it is not probable that future taxable amounts will be available for their offset. Accordingly, these deferred tax assets have not been recognised. 9 Cash and cash equivalents 2014 2013 US$m US$m Cash at bank 1,541 690 Short term deposits 857 1,468 2,398 2,158 10 Trade and other receivables 2014 2013 US$m US$m Trade debtors – iron ore 486 145 Trade debtors – other 44 26 GST receivables 39 46 Security deposits 1 166 Other receivables 15 26 Total current receivables 585 409 Other receivables 5 6 Total non-current receivables 5 6 Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 10 Trade and other receivables (continued) The carrying value of the receivables approximates their fair value. Information about Fortescue’s exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk are disclosed in note 34. Disclosures relating to receivables from related parties are set out in note 26. At 30 June 2014, trade receivables of US$9 million (2013: US$4 million) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of customers for whom there is no recent history of default. The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows: 2014 2013 US$m US$m Less than 30 days 7 2 Between 30 and 60 days 1 1 Beyond 60 days 1 1 9 4 Receivables that are classified as past due are those that have not been settled within the normal terms and conditions that have been agreed with the customer. None of the receivables past due in the above table are impaired. All other receivables within trade and other receivables are not impaired as it is expected that these amounts will be received 134 when due. 11 Inventories 2014 2013 US$m US$m Iron ore stockpiles 1,055 646 Warehouse stores and materials 412 315 1,467 961 Iron ore stockpiles, warehouse stores and materials are stated at cost.

The estimated fair value was determined using a trinomial option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date, expected price volatility of the underlying share, the effect of additional market conditions, the expected dividend yield, estimated share conversion factor and the risk free interest rate for the term of the right. The weighted average inputs used to determine the fair value of performance rights granted during the year ended 30 June 2014 were: (a) share price: A$5.35 (2013: A$4.07) (b) exercise price: nil (2013: nil) (c) volatility: 78 per cent (2013: 64 per cent) (d) option life: 21 months (2013: 24 months) (e) dividend yield: 2 per cent (2013: 2 per cent) (f ) risk free interest rate: 2.5 per cent (2013: 3 per cent) Details of options and performance rights outstanding at 30 June 2014 are presented in the following table: Vested and Balance exercisable at Remaining Exercise at the end the end contractual 149 price of the year of the year life A$ Number Number Months Employee options 2010 5.00 7,500,000 10 Long term performance rights 2013 Nil 2,935,785 18 Short term performance rights 2014 Nil 3,651,255 6 Long term performance rights 2014 Nil 5,139,280 30 19,226,320 (b) Other share-based payments The arrangement between certain of Fortescue’s Executives and The Minderoo Group Pty Ltd, as described in note 26, constitutes a share-based payment. The assessed fair value of this share-based payment at grant date was US$3,941,996, including US$985,499 expensed during the financial year (2013: US$985,499). The fair value at each grant date was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model that takes into account the four-year life of the instruments, the share prices at each grant date, the expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield risk free interest rate for the life of the instruments, the loan value per share, the loan interest rate and the terms of the margin call.

Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 33 Events occurring after the reporting period On 20 August 2014, the Directors declared a final dividend of 10 Australian cents per ordinary share payable on 3 October 2014. On 20 August 2014, Fortescue announced its intention to redeem US$500 million of the 2018 senior unsecured notes in October 2014. 34 Financial risk management Fortescue has a risk management programme that provides a structured approach to the management of risks across the business. The programme incorporates active management of financial risks arising from Fortescue’s activities to ensure that such risks are maintained within tolerable levels as required by the Board of Directors. Financial risks include market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board of Directors, through the Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC), has ultimate responsibility for oversight of the Fortescue Risk Management Framework (FRMF) and for setting appropriate risk tolerance levels. Day-to-day management responsibility for execution of the FRMF has been delegated to the CEO and the CFO. Periodically the CFO reports to the ARMC on risk management performance, including management of financial risks. The key elements of financial risk are further explained below. 152 (a) Market risk Market risk arises from Fortescue’s exposure to commodity price risk and the use of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates (foreign currency exchange risk), iron ore prices (commodity price risk) or interest rates (interest rate risk). (i) Foreign exchange risk Fortescue operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Australian dollar and the Euro. Fortescue is exposed to currency risk on cash reserves, trade and other receivables, borrowings, trade and other payables, derivatives held at fair value and other financial assets and liabilities. Fortescue’s policy is, where possible, to allow Group entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the cash generated from their own operations in that currency. Fortescue’s exposure to foreign exchange risks is measured using sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting. Fortescue’s risk management policy is to target specific levels at which to convert United States dollars to Australian dollars by entering into either spot or short term forward exchange contracts and to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows in relation to the 155mtpa expansion program in Australian dollars. All of the projected cash flows related to the expansion program qualified as highly probable forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 34 Financial risk management (continued) The carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in three currencies as set out below: USD AUD EURO Total 30 June 2013 US$m US$m US$m US$m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 1,497 660 1 2,158 Trade and other receivables 145 223 1 369 Other financial assets 6 6 Derivatives held at fair value 12 12 Total financial assets 1,654 889 2 2,545 Financial liabilities Borrowings and finance lease liabilities 12,224 467 12,691 Trade and other payables 380 816 2 1,198 Total financial liabilities 12,604 1,283 2 13,889 USD AUD EURO Total 30 June 2014 US$m US$m US$m US$m 153 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 2,110 288 2,398 Trade and other receivables 487 65 1 553 Total financial assets 2,597 353 1 2,951 Financial liabilities Borrowings and finance lease liabilities 9,548 9 9,557 Trade and other payables 619 822 1,441 Total financial liabilities 10,167 831 10,998 A change of five per cent in the Australian dollar against the currencies above at 30 June 2014 would have an impact on pre-tax profit and loss of US$24 million (2013: US$108 million). This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. (ii) Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk through iron ore price movements. Fortescue had not entered into any forward commodity price contracts at 30 June 2014 (2013: nil) and is currently fully exposed to commodity price movements as follows: 2014 2013 US$m US$m Trade receivables 486 171 Derivative held at fair value 12 486 183 A change of 15 per cent in commodity prices would have an impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and loss of US$73 million (2013: US$24 million). This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign exchange, remain constant. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 34 Financial risk management (continued) (iii) Interest rate risk It is Fortescue’s policy to reduce interest rate risk over the cash flows on its long term debt finance within tolerable levels set by ARMC through the use of fixed rate instruments whenever appropriate. Fortescue’s main interest rate risk arises from floating rates on the senior secured credit facility and changes in rates on short term investments. The Group’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost and are not subject to interest rate risk as defined in AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. Other financial instruments of the Group are non-interest bearing and are also not subject to interest rate risk as defined in AASB 7. At 30 June 2014, Fortescue had the following variable rate assets and liabilities: 2014 2013 US$m US$m Cash and cash equivalents 2,393 2,143 Senior secured credit facility (4,795) (4,828) (2,402) (2,685) Management analyses the Group’s interest rate exposure on a regular basis by simulation of various scenarios taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing options and hedging. 154 A change of ten basis points in interest rates in variable instruments would have an impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and loss of US$3 million (2013: US$7 million). This analysis assumes that all other factors remain constant, including foreign currency rates. (b) Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to Fortescue and is managed on a consolidated basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions and receivables from customers. Fortescue is exposed to a concentration of risk with the majority of its iron ore customers being located in China. This risk is mitigated by a policy of only trading with creditworthy counterparties and Fortescue further mitigates its credit risk by obtaining security in the form of letters of credit covering approximately 95 per cent of the value of iron ore shipped. Fortescue has not recognised any bad debt expense from trading counterparties in the financial years ended 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2013. The exposure to the credit risk from cash and short term deposits held in banks is managed by the treasury department and monitored by the Board of Directors. Fortescue minimises the credit risks by holding funds with a range of financial institutions with the credit ratings approved by the Board. The analysis of receivables past due is presented in note 10. Fortescue does not consider there to be any potential impairment loss on these receivables. (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring actual and forecast cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the period to the contracted maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

(d) Fair values 155 All financial assets and financial liabilities, with the exception of derivatives, are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration paid or received, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, the financial assets and financial liabilities, other than derivatives, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying values of the financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values, with the exception of the senior unsecured notes and senior secured credit facility with the fair values of US$4,690 million and US$4,925 million respectively. These fair values are based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period and as such are classified as level 1 financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy. (e) Capital management Fortescue’s capital management policy provides a framework to maintain a strong capital structure to sustain the future development and expansion of the business and to provide consistent returns to its equity shareholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings and finance lease liabilities as detailed in note 17 offset by cash and bank balances) and the equity of the Group (comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in the statement of changes in equity). Fortescue has built significant flexibility in its debt capital structure. This flexibility allows Fortescue to manage debt through voluntary repayment or refinancing to extend maturity dates to match the Group’s long life assets. The Group monitors capital using financial and non-financial indicators. Financial indicators include, but are not limited to, gearing, interest coverage and leverage ratios. Target ranges for ratios are provided dependent upon the investment and commodity cycle. During periods of intensive investment, for example expansion programmes, or a commodity cycle downturn, the capital policy contemplates interim ratio levels moving to a targeted longer term level. Interim levels acknowledge and consider the requirements, in certain circumstances, for remedial action to be taken. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. (a) Principles of consolidation (i) Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the Group’s business combinations. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively. 156 (ii) Joint arrangements Joint arrangements exist when two or more parties have joint control. Joint control exists when the parties agree contractually to share control over the activities that significantly affect the entity’s returns (relevant activities), and the decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing joint control. Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, based on the contractual rights and obligations between the parties to the arrangement. Joint operations If the contractual arrangement specifies the rights to the assets and the obligations for the liabilities for the parties, the arrangement is classified as a joint operation. The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings. Details of the joint operations are set out in note 27. To support operations and construction projects of some of the joint operations, Fortescue and other parties to the joint arrangements are required, from time to time, to contribute funds in the form of cash calls, in proportion to their respective interests in the joint arrangements. These funds, if contributed by the joint venture parties in different financial years, may give rise to deferred joint venture contribution assets or liabilities. Joint ventures If the contractual arrangement grants the parties the right to the arrangement’s net assets, it is classified as a joint venture. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the consolidated balance sheet. (b) Employee share trust The Group has formed a trust to administer its employee share schemes. The trust is consolidated as the substance of the relationship is that the trust is controlled by the Group. Shares held by the share trust are disclosed as treasury shares and deducted from contributed equity. (c) Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (d) Foreign currency translation (i) Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies have been converted at rates of exchange ruling at the date of those transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the year end translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when they are deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. (ii) Foreign operations The results and financial position of foreign operations that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: • assets and liabilities are translated at the closing foreign exchange rate at the date of the balance sheet; • income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the periods presented (unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used); and • all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings designated as hedges of the investment, are recognised in other comprehensive income. Should a foreign 157 operation be sold or any borrowings forming part of the net investment be repaid, a proportionate share of the exchange difference is reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale where applicable. (e) Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Fortescue recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities as described below. (i) Sale of products Revenue from the sale of products is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, indicating that there has been a transfer of risks and rewards of ownership to the customer, no further work or processing is required by the Group, the quantity and quality of the products have been determined with reasonable accuracy, the price can be reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured. Fortescue recognises revenue from the sale of iron ore when the risks and rewards of ownership transfers to the buyer. The sales price is determined on a provisional basis and adjustments to the sales price may subsequently occur depending on movements in quoted market or contractual iron ore prices to the date of final pricing and final product specifications. The date of final pricing is typically when a notice of readiness is received when the vessel has arrived at its final destination. Revenue is recognised based on the estimated fair value of the total consideration receivable. The fair value of the final consideration is re-estimated at each reporting date and any changes in the fair value are recognised as an adjustment to revenue. (ii) Services revenue Revenue from the provision of services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. (iii) Interest income Interest income is accrued using the effective interest rate method. (f) Deferred income Deferred income represents payments collected but not earned at the end of the reporting period. These payments are recognised as revenue when the goods are delivered or services are provided. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (g) Income tax The income tax expense for the year is the tax payable on the current year’s taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the taxation laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the taxation authorities. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised for future deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses, only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. 158 Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legal right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Fortescue Metals Group Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation as of 1 July 2002, namely the FMG tax consolidated group, and are therefore taxed as a single entity from that date. In addition, FMG Iron Bridge (Aust) Pty Ltd and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation as of 28 September 2011, namely the FMG Iron Bridge tax consolidated group, and are therefore taxed as a single entity from that date. The head entity and the controlled entities in both tax consolidated groups continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in each tax consolidated group continues to be a standalone taxpayer in its own right. In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity of each group also recognises the current tax liabilities, or assets, and the deferred tax assets it has assumed from unused tax losses and unused tax credits from controlled entities in the each corresponding tax consolidated group. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) Assets or liabilities arising within the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. Any differences between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement are recognised as a contribution to, or distribution from, wholly-owned tax consolidated entities. All the entities in the FMG tax consolidated group have entered into a valid and current tax sharing agreement which, in the opinion of the Directors, limits the joint and several liability of the wholly-owned entities in the case of an income tax obligation default by the head entity. (h) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, short term deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. (i) Trade receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that Fortescue will not be able to collect all amounts due. Collectibility of trade receivables is reviewed on a monthly basis. When there is objective evidence that Fortescue will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables, an allowance for impairment of trade receivables is raised. Total receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount 159 directly. Significant financial difficulties of the customer, probability that the customer will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable may not be collected. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the trade receivable carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. The amount of the impairment allowance is recognised in profit and loss within other administration expenses. When a trade receivable for which an impairment allowance had been recognised becomes uncollectible in a subsequent period, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other administration expenses. (j) Inventories Warehouse stores and materials, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs for raw materials and stores are determined as the purchase price. For partly processed and saleable iron ore, cost is based on the weighted average cost method and includes: • labour costs, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of iron ore; • production overheads, including attributable mining and manufacturing overheads; • the depreciation of mine development assets and of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction, processing and transportation of iron ore; and • transportation expenditure in bringing such inventories to their existing location and condition, together with an appropriate portion of fixed and variable overhead expenditure. Iron ore stockpiles represent iron ore that has been extracted and is available for further processing or sale. Quantities are assessed primarily through internal and third party surveys. Where there is an indication that inventories are obsolete or damaged, these inventories are written down to net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (k) Financial assets Fortescue classifies its financial assets into loans, receivables and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. (i) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and include trade receivables. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date which are classified as non-current assets. (ii) Financial assets through profit or loss This category comprises only derivative financial instruments. They are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. (l) Financial liabilities (i) Trade payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Group has an obligation to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. 160 (ii) Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised. (iii) Finance lease liabilities The Group has finance lease liabilities in relation to certain items of property, plant and equipment. Finance lease liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the underlying assets or, if lower, the estimated present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost and the finance cost is charged to profit and loss over the lease period to reflect a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. (m) Derivatives and hedge accounting Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of foreign exchange risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is immediately recognised in profit or loss within other income or other expense. The Group documents at the inception of the hedging transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. When the forecast transaction that is being hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains and losses previously deferred in other comprehensive income are transferred from equity and adjust the cost of the asset. When a hedging instrument expires, is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to profit or loss. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (n) Property, plant and equipment (i) Recognition and measurement Each class of property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less, where applicable, any accumulated depreciation and impairment loss. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing an asset to a working condition ready for its intended use. Assets under construction are recognised in assets under development. Upon commissioning, which is the date when the asset is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the assets are transferred into property, plant and equipment or development assets, as appropriate. Cost may also include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Borrowing costs related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised. When separate parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Borrowing costs related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised. When separate parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of the equipment. Gains and losses arising on disposal of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss and determined by 161 comparing proceeds from the sale of the assets to their carrying amount. (ii) Subsequent costs Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these subsequent costs will flow to Fortescue and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Ongoing repairs and maintenance are recognised as an expense in profit and loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. (iii) Depreciation Depreciation on assets, other than land which is not depreciated, is calculated using the straight-line method or units of production method, net of residual values, over estimated useful lives. Depreciation commences on the date when an asset is available for use, that is, when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the individual asset’s useful life and the lease term. Straight-line method Where the useful life is not linked to the quantities of iron ore produced, assets are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: • Buildings 20 – 25 years • Rolling stock 25 – 30 years • Plant and equipment 5 – 20 years • Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 – 8 years • Rail and port infrastructure assets 40 – 50 years The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) Units of production method Where the useful life of an asset is directly linked to the extraction of iron ore from a mine, the asset is depreciated using the units of production method. The units of production method is an amortised charge proportional to the depletion of the estimated proven and probable reserves at the mine. (iv) Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure Exploration and evaluation activities involve the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of interest. Exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised and carried forward to the extent that: • rights to tenure of the identifiable area of interest are current; and • at least one of the following conditions is also met: (i) the expenditure is expected to be recouped through the successful development of the identifiable area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; or (ii) where activities in the identifiable area of interest have not, at the reporting date, reached a stage that 162 permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and activities in, or in relation to, the area of interest, are continuing. Exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed at each reporting date for indicators of impairment and tested for impairment where such indicators exist. If the test indicates that the carrying value might not be recoverable, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount. These charges are recognised as impairment expense in profit and loss. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous years. Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclassified from exploration and evaluation expenditure to development expenditure. Development expenditure includes capitalised exploration and evaluation costs, pre-production development costs, development studies and other expenditure pertaining to that area of interest. Costs related to surface plant and equipment and any associated land and buildings are accounted for as property, plant and equipment. Development costs are accumulated in respect of each separate area of interest. Costs associated with commissioning new assets in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised. Development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit. When an area of interest is abandoned or the Directors decide that it is not commercially or technically feasible, any accumulated cost in respect of that area is written off in the financial period that decision is made. Each area of interest is reviewed at the end of each accounting period and the accumulated costs written off to profit and loss to the extent that they will not be recoverable in the future. Amortisation of development costs capitalised is charged on a unit of production basis over the life of estimated proven and probable reserves at the mine. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (o) Stripping costs (i) Development stripping costs Overburden and other mine waste materials are often removed during the initial development of a mine in order to access the mineral deposit. This activity is referred to as development stripping and the directly attributable costs, inclusive of an allocation of relevant overhead expenditure, are capitalised as development costs. Capitalisation of development stripping costs ceases and amortisation of those capitalised costs commences upon commercial extraction of ore. Amortisation of capitalised development stripping costs is determined on a unit of production basis for each area of interest. Development stripping costs are considered in combination with other assets of an operation for the purpose of undertaking impairment assessments. (ii) Production stripping costs Overburden and other mine waste materials continue to be removed throughout the production phase of the mine. This activity is referred to as production stripping, with the associated costs charged to the income statement, as operating cost, except when all three criteria below are met: • production stripping activity provides improved access to the specific component of the ore body, and it is probable that economic benefit arising from the improved access will be realised in future periods; • the Group can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved; and 163 • the costs relating to the production stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably. If all of the above criteria are met, production stripping costs resulting in improved access to the identified component of the ore body are capitalised as part of development asset and are amortised over the life of the component of the ore body. The determination of components of the ore body is individual for each mine. The allocation of costs between production stripping activity and the costs of ore produced is performed using relevant production measures, typically strip ratios. Changes to the mine design, technical and economic parameters affecting life of the components and strip ratios, are accounted for prospectively. (p) Leases Leases of assets where Fortescue, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the underlying assets or the present value of the future minimum lease payments. The corresponding finance lease liability is classified as borrowings. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to Fortescue as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. (q) Rehabilitation provision Provisions are recognised when Fortescue has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. The mining, extraction and processing activities of Fortescue give rise to obligations for site rehabilitation. Rehabilitation obligations can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, land rehabilitation and site restoration. The extent of work required and the associated costs are estimated using current restoration standards and techniques. Provisions for the cost of each rehabilitation program are recognised at the time that environmental disturbance occurs. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) Rehabilitation provisions are initially measured at the expected value of future cash flows required to rehabilitate the relevant site, discounted to their present value using Australian Government bond market yields that match, as closely as possible, the timing of the estimated future cash outflows. The judgements and estimates applied for the estimation of the rehabilitation provisions are discussed in note 36. When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised into the cost of mine development assets, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation. The capitalised cost of closure and rehabilitation activities is recognised within development assets and is amortised based on the units of production method over the life of the mine. The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds, creating an expense recognised in finance costs. At each reporting date the rehabilitation liability is re-measured to account for any new disturbance, updated cost estimates, inflation, changes to the estimated reserves and lives of operations, new regulatory requirements, environmental policies and revised discount rates. Changes to the rehabilitation liability are added to or deducted from the related rehabilitation asset and amortised accordingly. (r) Impairment of non-financial assets Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Group conducts an internal review of asset values bi-annually, which is used as a source of information to assess for any indications of impairment. External factors, such as changes in expected future prices, costs and other 164 market factors are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount is calculated, being the higher of fair value less direct costs to sell and the asset’s value in use. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Fair value for mineral assets is generally determined using independent market assumptions to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual disposal. These cash flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset. Value in use is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. Value in use is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group’s continued use and does not take into account future development. In testing for indications of impairment and performing impairment calculations, assets are considered as collective groups and referred to as cash generating units. Cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets and liabilities that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Impaired assets are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. (s) Intangible assets Costs incurred in developing products or systems and costs incurred in acquiring software and licenses that will contribute to future period financial benefits through revenue generation or cost reduction are capitalised as software. Costs capitalised include external direct costs of materials and consultants services, direct payroll and payroll related costs of employees’ time spent on the project. IT development costs include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase and are only recognised following completion of technical feasibility and where Fortescue has an intention and ability to use the asset. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over periods generally ranging from 3 to 5 years. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (t) Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest expense, excluding interest expenses incurred for the construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, unwinding of the discount on provisions and impairment losses recognised on financial assets. Interest expense and other borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds used to finance an asset form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings during the construction period. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. (u) Trade and other payables These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months from the reporting date. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. (v) Employee benefits (i) Wages and salaries and annual leave 165 Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in other payables and accruals in respect of employee services up to the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. (ii) Long service leave The liability for long service leave is recognised in provisions and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, probability of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on Australian Government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. The liability for long service leave for which settlement within 12 months of the reporting date cannot be deferred is recognised in the current provision for employee benefits. The liability for long service leave for which settlement can be deferred beyond 12 months from the reporting date is recognised in the non-current provision for employee benefits. (w) Share-based payments Share-based remuneration benefits are primarily provided to employees via the Fortescue Metals Group Incentive Option Scheme (FMGIOS) and Performance Rights Plan (PRP). Information relating to these schemes is set out in note 30. The fair value of options granted under the FMGIOS and PRP are recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options or rights. The fair value at grant date is independently determined using trinomial option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the effect of additional market conditions, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option or right. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) The fair value of the options and rights granted is measured to reflect expected market vesting conditions, but excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. The employee benefit expense recognised each period takes into account the most recent estimate. The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit and loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity. (x) Dividends Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. (y) Earnings per share (i) Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the year after income tax attributable to the ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during the financial year. (ii) Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the year after income tax attributable to the ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during the financial year, after adjusting for the effects of all potential dilutive ordinary shares that were outstanding during the financial year. 166 (z) Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the balance sheet are shown inclusive of GST. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included as a current asset or liability in the balance sheet. Cash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a gross basis, except for the GST component of investing and financing activities, which is disclosed as an operating cash flow. (aa) Comparatives Where applicable, certain comparatives have been adjusted to conform with current year presentation. (ab) New accounting standards and interpretations (i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 July 2013: • AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. AASB 10 introduces certain changes to the consolidation principles, including the concept of de facto control and changes in relation to special purpose entities. The adoption of AASB 10 had no impact on the amounts recognised in Fortescue’s financial statements. • AASB 11 Joint Arrangements. AASB 11 changes the classification and accounting for joint arrangements based on the specified rights and obligations of the agreement. Fortescue has determined that its interests in joint arrangements were not affected by the adoption of the new standard. • AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. AASB 12 sets out the required disclosures for entities reporting under AASB 10 and AASB 11. The required disclosure of the new standard is included in note 27 Interests in Other Entities. • AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement. AASB 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value of financial and nonfinancial items recognised at fair value. Fortescue does not have any significant assets or liabilities recorded at fair value at 30 June 2014, therefore this standard has not impacted on the current year financial statements. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 35 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) • IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine. IFRIC 20 addresses the accounting for deferred stripping costs and requires the capitalisation of the component of waste removal costs that provides an improved access to the ore body. Fortescue has determined that, given the nature of its iron ore reserves and extraction methods used, the benefits from stripping activity during its production stage predominantly relate to the inventory produced. No adjustments to any of the carrying amounts in the financial statements are required as a result of the adoption of Interpretation 20. • AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures. AASB 124 removes certain individual key management personnel disclosure requirements and have no impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. • AASB 2011-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards. AASB 2011-4 removes the individual key management personnel disclosure requirements from the financial statements to the Directors’ report. (ii) New accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 30 June 2014 reporting periods. These standards and interpretations have not been early adopted. • AASB 9 Financial Instruments and AASB 2009-11 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 and AASB 2010-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 (December 2010) (effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015). AASB 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. Fortescue has determined that AASB 9 will have no material 167 impact on the way the Group accounts for its financial instruments. 36 Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates and form assumptions that affect how certain assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and equity are reported. At each reporting period, management evaluates its judgements and estimates based on historical experience and on other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Fortescue has identified the following critical accounting policies where significant judgements and estimates are made by management in the preparation of these financial statements. (i) Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations. Significant judgement is required in determining the provisions for income taxes. There are certain transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination may be subject to change. Fortescue estimates its tax liabilities based on the Group’s understanding of the tax law at the time. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made. Fortescue recognises deferred tax assets relating to carried forward tax losses to the extent they can be utilised. The utilisation of the tax losses depends on the ability of the entities to generate sufficient future taxable profits. Fortescue Metals Group Limited I Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 June 2014 36 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued) (ii) Iron ore reserve estimates Iron ore reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from Fortescue’s current mining tenements. In order to calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and grade of ore reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies or fields to be determined by analysing geological data such as drilling samples. This requires complex and difficult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data. As economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change and as additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may vary from period to period. Changes in reported reserves may affect Fortescue’s financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following: • asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows; • depreciation and amortisation charges in profit and loss may change where such charges are determined by the units of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change; and • the carrying value of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of tax benefits. (iii) Exploration and evaluation expenditure 168 Fortescue’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in expenditure being capitalised for an area of interest where it is considered likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or sale or where the activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves. This policy requires management to make certain estimates as to future events and circumstances, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalised the expenditure under the policy, a judgement is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to profit and loss. (iv) Development expenditure Development activities commence after commercial viability and technical feasibility of the project is established. Judgement is applied by management in determining when a project is commercially viable and technically feasible. In exercising this judgement, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions as to the future events. If, after having commenced the development activity, a judgement is made that a development asset is impaired, the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to profit and loss. (v) Property, plant and equipment – recoverable amount The determination of fair value and value in use requires management to make estimates about expected production and sales volumes, commodity prices, reserves (see ‘iron ore reserve estimates’ above), operating costs, rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditure. Changes in circumstances may alter these projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying value of the assets may be impaired and the impairment would be charged to profit and loss. (vi) Rehabilitation estimates Fortescue’s accounting policy for the recognition of rehabilitation provisions requires significant estimates including the magnitude of possible works required for the removal of infrastructure and of rehabilitation works, future cost of performing the work, the inflation and discount rates and the timing of cash flows. These uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.
