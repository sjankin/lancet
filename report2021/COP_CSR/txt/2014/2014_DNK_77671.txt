Legitimate and Responsible Business Practices Based on an analysis conducted by Deloitte in November and December of 2013, we consider how SE can further strengthen its future CSR effort.

When we actively choose to put CSR on the agenda, it is with the desire to take advantage of our strengths and competencies to lift the community that we are a part of. We want to support the conversion to a greener energy system and deliver the digital infrastructure of the future. We don’t do this just because we can, but because it’s the right thing to do. To SE, CSR is more than a framework for sustainable corporate conduct, in everyday operations as well as in our involvement in the community; it is a natural part of our culture, our cooperative DNA, and the way we do business. Simply stated: CSR is something we deliver every single day at SE; it’s the story of how our visions and big plans are made into reality – a reality that makes a difference for our customers, owners, stakeholders, employees, and the community that we are a part of. We do what we say we will – and we’ll keep on doing it At SE, there is action behind our words, and we are not afraid of being the one to take the first step on a new playing field. When we say that we are going to reduce the environmental impact, we first take a look at ourselves and use the competencies we have to create the most sustainable and profitable operations. We don’t want to just go with the flow; we want to show a conduct that will inspire others.

However, we should note that with the acquisition of Stofa, we have received an added environmental impact. It is a process with which we are continuously involved. From day one, SE’s access to CSR has been an important guideEnjoy reading SE’s CSR Report 2013 line for our colleagues at Stofa. A number of other initiatives and strong partnerships came into existence and bore fruit in 2013. The roll-out of fiber optics is continuing.

They are a natural part of the daily attitude with which we face each other and the outside world, and they are the foundation for what we call “the total customer experience”. Our values – openness, closeness, courage, and sustainability – enable us to vouch for our business and live up to our role as a promoter and provider of CSR measures. Cutting our own CO2 emissions in half If anyone is to “walk the talk” in terms of CSR and sustainability, then of course it’s us. For this reason, we want to cut our own CO2 emissions in half by 2020 comBaseline comparison 2012 and 2013 CO2 emissions in tons (excl. grid loss) pared to the total emissions of 8,863 tons of CO2 in 2011. This will particularly happen as we reduce our own energy consumption and our own environmental impact. The goal includes electricity, heat, and fuel consumption for our buildings, 10,000 servers, transformer stations, and street lighting. Emissions derived from net loss – 9,000 kWh lost during transportation in the electricity grid – are not included in the goal. 8,000 Although SE continues to work intensively on reducing the net loss, a certain net 7,000 loss will be inevitable when electricity is transported through an electricity grid.

It may sound idealistic, but it is really good business and the basis for the total customer experience. We strive for a healthy and attractive workplace with an emphasis on well-being and where employees are proud of where they work and enjoy coming to work.

At SE, we want to become involved in the society that we are a part of. We want to be present in our service area and show openness in our business and activities. To SE, the fundamental philosophy is that we want to unite two mega trends: sustainability and digitalization. We do this to strengthen the local community while creating new business opportunities. We constantly ask ourselves big questions such as the following: What do we need to do to strengthen our competitive edge? How can we create and maintain jobs? What is needed to develop new skills and support cohesion? We are convinced that sustainability and digitalization will provide many of the answers to these questions. For this reason, we often want to participate in solving issues and implementing some of the synergies that can ensure that our local community is developed and benefits from the inherent possibilities. SE to create a digital cooperative movement An important investment for our supply area has been the implementation of fiberoptic broadband; we are convinced that it will contribute to establishing a foundation for the necessary growth and development.

We have obtained limited assurance because, compared to a reasonable assurance engagement, our work has been limited primarily to inquiries and interviews of company personnel as well as analytical procedures around registration and communication systems, data and the underlying documentation. In addition we have ensured that the report meets the requirements of the UN Global Compact Policy on Communicating Progress, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Version 3.0, and the Danish Financial Statements Act §99a and §99b.

We have not interviewed external stakeholders or reviewed any forward-looking statements, such as goals and expectations, nor individuals referenced in the report. Therefore we draw no conclusion from these statements.

We confirm that the report meets the requirements of the UN Global Compact Communication on Progress as well as the Danish Financial Statements Act §99a and §99b, and that it is drawn up with the help of GRI >> Version 3.0.
