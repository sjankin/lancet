difficult year for the Serbian economy and the banking sector as a whole. Although 2013 there was a growth in economic output (GDP grew by 2.5%), this was to a large extent the result of a low base effect and the rise in net exports due to a set of specific events (such as the full operation of the FIAT factory in Kragujevac and the renovated NIS refinery in Pancevo) rather than the implementation of structural reforms leading to sustainable growth. The macroeconomic environment in 2013 remained challenging. A fiscal consolidation programme introduced at the end of 2012 did not halt the rise of the budget deficit and the public debt (61.2% of GDP). The unemployment rate remained amongst the highest in Europe (over 20%) whilst net FDIs stagnated at only EUR 760m. The banking sector recorded an overall loss (EUR 18m) for the first time in a decade. Half of the 30 commercial banks operating in the country registered losses, whilst the NBS revoked the license of 2 domestic banks. Total lending dropped by 5.3% y-o-y to EUR 16.3bn mainly due to the decrease of loans to non– households (–9% y–o–y). On the other hand, deposits increased by 2.6% y–o–y reaching EUR 13.7bn. At the end of 2013, the share of NPLs in total loans reached 22.3% (with the highest share of NPLs coming from legal entities and entrepreneurs). Despite these negative trends, the quality of the banking sector’s balance sheet remained satisfactory (CAD at 20.9%, NPLs provided for by 117.9%) primarily due to the prudent risk and capital management by most banks and the efforts of the supervisor. In this adverse environment, Eurobank achieved satisfactory profitability and maintained its healthy capital and liquidity positions. In particular: ●F  Y 2013 profit reached RSD 1,4bn.

Beograd and Nacionalna Štedionica Banka a.d. that was completed on 20 October 2006. The Bank is registered in Serbia for carrying out payment, credit and deposit operations in the country and abroad. The bank operates in accordance with Law on Banks based on the principles of liquidity, safety and profitability. The registered office of the Bank is Vuka Karadžića 10, Belgrade. As at 31 December 2013 the Bank had 1,548 employees (31 December 2012: 1,512 employees). The Bank’s network comprises of 105 branches and business centres (31 December 2012: 107 ). The Bank’s Registration number is 17171178. The Bank’s Tax identification number is 100002532. These financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2014. 2. Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 2.1. Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting and Auditing Law which requires full compliance with IFRS, as well as in accordance with the regulations of the National bank of Serbia. These regulations are as follows: Rules on the Forms and Content of Items in Financial Statement Forms to be Completed by Banks (Official gazette of RS no. 74/2008, 3/2009, 12/2009 and 5/2010), Rules on the Chart of Accounts and Content of Accounts within the Chart for Banks (Official gazette of RS no. 98/2007, 57/2008 and 3/2009), Accounting and Auditing Law (Official gazette of RS no. 111/2009) Decision of the Ministry of Finance Republic of Serbia no. 401-00-380/2010 on 25 October 2010 (Official gazette of RS no. 77/2010 and 95/2010) sets the official translation of basic International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as interpretations of the standards issued by International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) on 1 January 2009, which are in use on the date of preparation of accompanying financial statements. The applied accounting policies differ from the IFRS requirements in the following materially significant areas: 4 Annual Report 2013 ● At the time the accompanying financial statements were approved for issue, there were amendments and supplements of the existing standards, as well as revised standards and new interpretations issued by IASB and IFRIC, being in force the current reporting period (i.e. first time adopted for the financial year starting 1 January 2013), which were not officially translated by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Serbia. The mentioned amendments, supplements, and new interpretations, which are not officially translated in the Republic of Serbia, are disclosed in Note 2.1. a) and b). ● The Bank has not made certain disclosures in accordance with IAS 1 Such as – Presentation of financial statements – since the presentation of the financial statements is defined by the National Bank of Serbia. ● “Off-balance sheet assets and liabilities” are disclosed in the balance sheet form (Note 38). In accordance with IFRS, off-balance sheet items do not represent either assets or liabilities. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3. The Bank’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Bank will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. a) Amended and new standards and interpretations effective in 2013 for EU The following new standards and amendments to existing standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union (EU), applied from 1 January 2013: ● IAS 1, Amendment – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income ● IAS 12, Amendment – Deferred tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets ● IAS 19, Amendment – Employee Benefits ● IFRS 7, Amendment – Disclosures, Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ● IFRS 13, Fair value measurement ● Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2009–2011 Cycle b) Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective for EU A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards are effective after 2013, as they have not yet been endorsed for use in the European Union or have not been early applied. Those that may be relevant are set out below: ● IAS 19, Amendment – Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (effective 1 January 2015, not yet endorsed by EU) ● IAS 27, Amendment – Separate Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2014) ● IAS 28, Amendment – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (effective 1 January 2014) ● IAS 32, Amendment – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (effective 1 January 2014) 5 Annual Report 2013 ● IAS 36, Amendment – Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (effective 1 January 2014) ● IAS 39, Amendment – Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting (effective 1 January 2014) ● IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (effective date to be determined by IASB) ● IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2014) ● IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements (effective 1 January 2014) ● IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective 1 January 2014) ● IFRS 10, 11 and 12 Amendments – Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: Transition Guidance (effective 1 January 2014) ● IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27 Amendments – Investment Entities (effective 1 January 2014) ● Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle (effective 1 January 2015, not yet endorsed by EU) ● Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle (effective 1 January 2015, not yet endorsed by EU) ● IFRIC 21, Levies (effective 1 January 2014, not yet endorsed by EU) These financial statements do not comply with all requirements of IFRS. Therefore, these financial statements are not prepared to present financial position of the Bank, result and cash flows in accordance with the accounting principles accepted outside of the Republic of Serbia. c) Impact of the economic crisis in Greece Greece entered into a new funding and restructuring programme with the European Commission, the ECB and the Eurozone member-states as agreed in the Eurogroup meeting of 21 February 2012. The programme aimed at bringing the country’s public debt-toGDP ratio below 120,0% by 2020. The new funding and reform programme improved the country’s financial position and outlook via the reduction of public debt and its servicing costs from 2012 onwards. On 26 November, 2012 these developments, and after the implementation/legislation of a long list of structural reforms and fiscal austerity measures for 2013-16 by the Greek Government, the Eurogroup reached an agreement on a set of new measures for the reduction of Greek public debt to 124.0% of GDP by 2020 and 110.0% of GDP in 2022. This debt path is consistent with the debt sustainability required by the IMF. d) Position of the Group Greek sovereign debt exchange programme On 21 February 2012 the Euro-area finance ministers agreed on a bailout programme for Greece, including financial assistance from the Official Sector and a voluntary debt exchange agreed with the Private Sector forgiving 53.5% of the face value of Greek debt. All exchanged bonds were derecognised and the new Greek government bonds (nGGBs) recognised at fair value, based on market quotes at the date of recognition. 6 Annual Report 2013 Following the Eurogroup’s decisions on 27 November 2012 and as part of debt reduction measures, the Greek State announced on 3 December 2012 an invitation to eligible holders of nGGBs to submit offers to exchange such securities for six months zero coupon notes to be issued by the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF). Under its participation to the Greek state’s debt buyback program, the Eurobank Ergasias Group submitted for exchange 100% of its nGGBs portfolio of total face value €2,3 billion. Recapitalisation Framework and Process Given the severity of the impact of the Greek Government Bond exchange programme (PSI+), on 21 February 2012 the Euro Area finance ministers allocated a total of €50 billion of the second support programme for Greece specifically for the recapitalisation of the Greek banking system. These funds were directed to the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) whose mandate has been extended and enhanced accordingly. €39 billion of these funds were remitted to Greece in 2012 and the final €11 billion in 2013. Recapitalisation of Eurobank Ergasias S.A. The Bank of Greece, after assessing the business plan and the capital needs of Eurobank Ergasias S.A. concluded on 19 April 2012 that Eurobank Ergasias S.A. is a viable bank and, on 8 November 2012, notified Eurobank Ergasias S.A. that its Tier I capital should increase by €5.839 million. Eurobank Ergasias S.A., the HFSF and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) signed on 28 May 2012, on 21 December 2012 and on 30 April 2013 a trilateral presubscription agreement (PSA) for the advance to Eurobank Ergasias S.A. of EFSF notes of face value of €3.970 million, €1.341 million and €528 million, respectively, (total €5.839 million), as advance payment of its participation in the share capital increase of Eurobank Ergasias S.A. On 7 April 2013, the relevant regulatory authorities, with the consent of the management of both banks, decided that National Bank of Greece S.A. (NBG) and Eurobank Ergasias S.A. will be independently recapitalised in full. As a consequence, the merger process of the two Banks was suspended. Following the above decision, the Board of Directors of Eurobank Ergasias S.A. evaluated the specificities of the exercise in relation with the attraction of capital from private investors and, in particular, the uncertainty regarding the completion or not of the merger with NBG, and the ensuing inability of properly assessing the investment proposal, as well as the absence of tens of thousands of Eurobank Ergasias S.A.’s traditional shareholders who were substituted, due to the recent Voluntary Tender Offer, by NBG’s stake of approximately 85% in Eurobank Ergasias S.A.’s capital. As a consequence, the Board of Directors of Eurobank Ergasias S.A. proposed to the Extraordinary General Meeting on 30 April 2013 that the share capital increase of €5.839 million should be fully subscribed by the HFSF. On 30 April 2013, the Extraordinary General Meeting approved the increase of the share capital of the Bank, in accordance with the provisions of Law 3864/2010 and Act of Cabinet 38/9.11.2012, in order to raise € 5,839 million by issuing 3,789,317,358 new ordinary shares, covered entirely by the HFSF with the contribution of bonds issued by the 7 Annual Report 2013 EFSF and owned by the HFSF. The capital increase was certified on 31 May 2013 and the listing of the new shares was completed on 19 June 2013 after obtaining the relevant approvals from Greek regulatory authorities. On 28 March 2013, the BoG issued an Executive Committee Act (13/28.03.2013) bringing the limit for the Core Tier I capital to 9% of Risk Weighted Assets and for Equity Core Tier I to 6%, effective from 31 March 2013. According to the new definition of Core Tier I capital, AFS reserve is fully recognised, while deferred tax asset's recognition is limited to 20% of Core Tier I capital. As per latest published financial statements, as at 30 September 2013, the Core Tier I ratio stood at 6.8% and proforma at 8.1% with the completion of transaction with Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (increase of Fairfax’s participation in Eurobank Properties S.A. through share capital increase) and the implementation of Basel II IRB credit risk methodology (subject to the approval of the Bank of Greece) to New TT Hellenic Postbank S.A. (NHPB) and New Proton Bank S.A. (New Proton) at 8.1%. On 23 December 2013, the BoG issued an Executive Committee Act (36/23.12.2013) abolishing the aforementioned limitation related to the deferred tax asset’s recognition, effective from 31 December 2013, which is expected to have a significant positive effect on Core Tier I ratio. e) Position of the Bank As at 31 December 2013, the Bank does not rely on funding from the Parent bank but predominantly on locally collected deposits, its own capital base and, to a lesser extent, funding from international financial institutions as disclosed in the Notes 29, 30, 31 and 37. The bank’s capital adequacy ratio (as prescribed by NBS) is significantly higher than the regulatory minimum of 12% (Note 40). Article 33 of the Law on Banks (RS Official Gazette No 107/05 and 91/10) prescribes that a bank’s exposure to a single related party must not exceed 5% of the bank’s regulatory capital. Sum of exposures to all related parties cannot exceed 20% of the bank’s capital. As at 31 December 2013, 31 December 2012 and the date of approval of these financial statements, the Bank's exposures to the related parties of the bank did not exceed the amount prescribed by the Law. 2.2. Basis of measurement The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following: ● Derivative financial instruments are measured at the fair value, ● Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, ● Financial instruments available for sale are measured at fair value and ● Liabilities from trading activities are measured at fair value. 2.3. Comparatives Comparative figures i.e. opening balances represent the Company’s figures as at 31 December 2012. 8 Annual Report 2013 2.4. Foreign currency translation a) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into the functional currency at the market rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are accounted for in the income statement. b) Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of the Bank are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The financial statements are presented in RSD (Serbian dinar), which is the Bank’s functional and presentation currency. 2.5. Derivatives The Bank uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts, forward currency agreements, currency swaps, and other derivative financial instruments, are initially recognized in the balance sheet at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into, and subsequently are re-measured at their fair value. Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices, including recent market transactions, discounted cash flow models as appropriate. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative. The best evidence of the fair value of a derivative at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received) unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e., without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. Embedded derivatives The Bank negotiates a foreign currency clause with the beneficiaries of the loans. Foreigncurrency clause is an embedded derivative that is not accounted for separately from the host contract since the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are closely related to the host contract. Gains/losses arising on this basis are recorded in the income statement as foreign exchange gains/losses. 9 Annual Report 2013 Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 2.6. Income statement a) Interest income and expense Interest income and expense for all interest-bearing financial instruments, except for those classified as held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss, are recognized within ‘interest income’ and ‘interest expense’ in the income statement using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Bank estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. b) Fee and commission income Fees and commissions are generally recognized on an accrual basis when the service has been provided. Fees and commissions mostly comprise of fees for payment operations services, issued guarantees and other services. Loan origination fees are deferred and amortized to interest earned on loans and advances over the life of the loan using the straight line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method. Loan origination fees are presented within Interest income (Note 6). 2.7. Property and equipment All property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured 10 Annual Report 2013 reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to income statement of the financial period in which they are incurred. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of other assets is calculated using the straight–line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: YEARS Buildings 77 Leasehold improvements up to 18 Computer equipment 5–7 Furniture and other equipment 7 – 25 Motor vehicles 5 The assets’ residual value represents the estimated amount that the Bank might obtain at present through the sale of the asset, decreased by the estimated cost of sale. If the Bank expects to utilize the asset until the expiration of its useful life, the residual value amounts to zero. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in other operating income/expenses in the income statement. 2.8. Intangible assets Licenses Licenses are initially recognized at cost. They have limited useful life and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives (from 1 to 15 years). Software Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives (15 years). Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Bank and will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognized as intangible assets. Direct costs include the costs of employees involved in software development. Computer software development costs recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives (not exceeding 10 years). 11 Annual Report 2013 2.9. Financial assets The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held–to–maturity investments; and available–for–sale financial assets. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition. a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category has two sub–categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. A financial asset is classified as held for trading if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term or if it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Derivatives are also categorized as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Financial assets and financial liabilities are designated for at fair value through profit or loss when: ● Doing so significantly reduces measurement inconsistencies that would arise if the related derivatives were treated as held for trading and the underlying financial instruments were carried at amortized cost; ● Certain investments, such as equity investments, are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy and reported to key management personnel on that basis; ● Financial instruments, such as debt securities held, containing one or more embedded derivatives which significantly modify the cash flows. b) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non–derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. c) Held–to–maturity financial assets Held–to–maturity investments are non–derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Bank’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Bank was to sell other than an insignificant amount of held-to-maturity assets, the entire category would be reclassified as available for sale. Held–to–maturity investments are stated at amortized cost using effective interest rate method. The amortized cost is calculated by taking into consideration all discounts and premiums received at the date of purchase. d) Available–for–sale financial assets Available–for–sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices. 12 Annual Report 2013 e) Accounting treatment and calculation Regular–way purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held– to –maturity and available–for–sale are recognized on trade–date – the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognized at fair value increased for transactions costs for all financial assets not held at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Bank has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available–for–sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables and held–to–maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for-sale financial assets are recognized directly in equity, until the financial asset is derecognized or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity is recognized in profit or loss. However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognized in the income statement. Dividends on equity instruments are recognized in the income statement when the entity’s right to receive payment is established. The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), the Bank establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. 2.10. Impairment of financial assets a) Assets carried at cost and amortized cost The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. The criteria that the Bank uses to determine whether there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include: ● Delinquency in contractual payments of principal or interest; ● Cash flow difficulties experienced by the borrower (for example, equity ratio, net income percentage of sales); ● Breach of loan covenants or conditions; ● Initiation of bankruptcy proceedings; ● Deterioration of the borrower’s competitive position; ● Deterioration in the value of collateral. 13 Annual Report 2013 The estimated period between a loss occurring and its identification is determined by the local management for each identified portfolio type. In general, the periods used vary between three and twelve months; in exceptional cases longer periods are warranted. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be recognized, are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted using the financial asset’s original interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current interest rate determined under the contract. The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralized financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable. For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics (i.e., on the basis of the Bank’s grading process that considers asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past-due status and other relevant factors). Those characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets by being indicative of the debtors’ ability to pay all amounts due, according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated. Future cash flows in a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets in the Bank and historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the Bank. Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not currently exist. Estimates of changes in future cash flows for groups of assets should reflect and be directionally consistent with changes in related observable data from period to period (for example, changes in unemployment rates, property prices, payment status, or other factors indicative of changes in the probability of losses in the Bank and their magnitude). The 14 Annual Report 2013 methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the Bank to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. When a loan is uncollectible, it is written off against the related allowance for loan impairment. Such loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account. The amount of the reversal is recognized in the income statement in impairment charge for credit losses. b) Assets classified as available–for–sale The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of securities classified as available–for–sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the assets are impaired. If any such evidence there are available–for–sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value – is recognized in the income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available–for–sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement. 2.11. Reserves for estimated losses in accordance with the requirements of the National Bank of Serbia In accordance with the Decision of the Central Bank of Serbia, the Bank is obliged to classify loans, other placements, guarantees and other on–balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures into the categories A, B, C, D and E, based on evaluation of their collectability and associated risk exposures, which depends upon the number of days the payments are in arrears, the financial position of the counterparty, and the quality of the collaterals obtained on the exposure. Reserve for estimated losses is calculated by applying the percentages of 0% for A category, 2% for B category, 15% for C category, 30% for D category and 100% for E category to the exposures classified in the respective categories (in 2012: 0% for A category, 2% for B category, 15% for C category, 30% for D category and 100% for E category). Required reserve for estimated losses is calculated as a difference between total reserve calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Central bank and impairment losses calculated in accordance with policy described in the Note 2.10. Required reserve for estimated losses represents a deductible item in capital adequacy calculation (Note 5.5). 15 Annual Report 2013 2.12. Impairment of non–financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 2.13. Sale and repurchase agreements Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements (‘repos’) are reclassified in the financial statements as pledged assets when the transferee has the right under contract or custom to sell or re-pledge the collateral; the counterparty liability is included in amounts due to other banks, deposits from banks, other deposits or deposits due to customers, as appropriate. Securities purchased under agreements to purchase and sell (“reverse repos”) are recorded as callable deposits and credits (Note 19). The difference between purchase and sale price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest rate method. 2.14. Borrowings Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities, unless the Bank has indisputable right to postpone the settlement of obligations for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 2.15. Leases The Bank is a lessee Leases entered into by the Bank are primarily operating leases. With an operating lease, a significant part of both risk and benefits remains with the lessor. The total payments made under operating leases are charged to other operating expenses in the income statement on straight–line basis over the period of the lease. When an operating lease is terminated before lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognized as an expense in the period in which termination takes place. The Bank is a lessor A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment, or series of payments, the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time. 16 Annual Report 2013 The Bank is leasing the assets under operating lease. The asset under operating lease is included in the balance sheet of the Bank based on the nature of the asset. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease on a straight–line basis. 2.16. Income tax and deferred income tax Income tax presents the amount calculated and paid to the tax authorities based on legislations of the Republic of Serbia. Estimated monthly instalments are calculated by the Tax authority and paid in advance on a monthly basis. Income tax at the rate of 15% is payable based on the profit calculated as per the tax return. In order to arrive at the taxable profit, the accounting profit is adjusted for certain differences and reduced for certain investments made during the year. Tax return is submitted to tax authorities until 30th June of the following year. Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and their amounts disclosed for reporting purposes, which will result in taxable amounts in future periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be sufficient to enable realization (utilization) of deductible temporary differences, unused tax assets and unused tax liabilities. Current/deferred income tax is recognized in the current year’s income statement. 2.17. Employee benefits a) Employee’s benefits Short–term benefits to employees include salaries and social contributions. They are recognized as an expense in the period when they are incurred. The Bank and its employees are obliged to make payments to the pension fund of the Republic of Serbia in accordance with the defined contribution plan. The Bank has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. b) Other employee’s benefits The Bank provides other benefits for the retirement. An employee is usually entitled to these benefits if s/he is employee of the Bank until reaching the prescribed age for retirement and the minimum required years of employment. The abovementioned benefits are accumulated during the service. The defined retirement obligations are estimated annually by an independent certified actuary through the projected credit unit valuation method. The present value of benefit obligations is determined by discounting the expected future cash payments by reference to the interest rates of the high quality bonds expressed 17 Annual Report 2013 in the same currency, which mature approximately at the same period when retirement obligations are due. c) Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Bank recognizes termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance sheet date are discounted to present value. 2.18. Repossessed properties Land and buildings repossessed through an auction process to recover impaired loans are, except where otherwise stated, included in “Other Assets”. Assets acquired from an auction process are held temporarily for liquidation and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Any gains or losses on liquidation are included in Other operating income . 2.19. Related party transactions Related parties include associates, fellow subsidiaries, directors, their close families, companies owned or controlled by them and companies whose financial and operating policies they can influence. Transactions of similar nature are disclosed on an aggregate basis. All banking transactions entered into with related parties are in the normal course of business and on an arm's length basis. 2.20. Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and reliable estimates of the amount of the obligation can be made. 2.21. Share capital a) Share issue costs Share issue costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction. b) Dividends on ordinary shares Dividends are recognized as liabilities for the period in which the decision of their payment has been reached. Dividends approved for the year after the balance sheet date are dealt with in the subsequent events note. 2.22. Financial guarantees Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make 18 Annual Report 2013 payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and other bodies on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities. Financial guarantees are initially recognized in the financial statements at fair value on the date the guarantee was given. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Bank’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of the initial measurement, less amortization calculated to recognize in the income statement the fee income earned on a straight line basis over the life of the guarantee and the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle any financial obligation arising at the balance sheet date. These estimates are determined based on the experience of similar transactions and the history of past losses, supplemented by the judgment of Management. Any increase in the liability relating to guarantees is taken into the income statement. 2.23. Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with less than three months’ maturity from the date of acquisition, including cash and non-restricted balances with Central Bank, treasury bills and other eligible bills, loans and advances to banks, amounts due from other banks and short-term government securities. 2.24. Assets managed on behalf of third parties The bank manages foreign currency frozen bonds issued by the Republic of Serbia on behalf of the state and acts as an agent in this business. 3. Critical accounting estimates and judgments The Bank makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. a) Impairment losses on loans and advances The Bank reviews its loan portfolios to assess impairment on a monthly basis. In determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in the income statement, the Bank makes judgments as to whether there is any observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio of loans before the decrease can be identified with an individual loan in that portfolio. The evidence may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash 19 Annual Report 2013 flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. b) Income tax The Bank is subject to income taxes in Serbia. Certain estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. c) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices (financial assets) or offer prices (financial liabilities). If there is no active market for a financial instrument, the Bank establishes fair value using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. The valuation models reflect current market conditions at the measurement date which may not be representative of market conditions either before or after the measurement date. As at the balance sheet date management reviews its models to ensure they appropriately reflect current market conditions, including the relative liquidity of the market and credit spreads. 4. Financial assets per categories and classes Financial assets per categories and classes are as follows: 2013 2012 Loans and receivables 89,496,540 104,477,053 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 21,697 13,093 Financial assets held to maturity 9,686,689 6,315,976 Financial assets available for sale 14,684,340 12,702,869 TOTAL 113,889,266 123,508,991 5. Risk management policies The Bank’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks and those activities involve the analysis, evaluation, acceptance and management of some degree of risk or combination of risks. Risk management is done through specialized Risk management division. The Bank has defined procedures for risk identification, measurement and risk management in accordance with regulations and best practices. The Bank’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse these risks, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems. The Bank is exposed to the following most important risks: 20 Annual Report 2013 5.1. Credit risk 5.2. Market risk 5.3. Liquidity risk 5.4. Operational risks Market risk includes: ● Foreign currency risk ● Interest rate risk ● Other price risks 5.1. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Bank’s loans and advances to customers and banks and investment securities. For risk management reporting purposes, the Bank considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure (such as individual obligor default risk, sector risk, repayment risk, etc.). 5.1.1. Management of credit risk The Bank approves loans in accordance with its business policy and by adjusting maturity dates of loans approved and interest rates with the purpose of loans, type of the loan or client and creditworthiness of its clients. For risk management purposes, credit risk arising on trading securities is managed independently, but reported as a component of market risk exposure. The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for the approval of credit exposures to several different levels in accordance with the limits set forth by the Board. The underlying foundation of the credit processes is the application of the “four-eye principle” on one side from the Business Units and on the other side from Risk Management for all exposures above the business unit level of approval. In case of exposures approved within the business unit level of approval, the “four-eye principle” is ensured within that business unit. Business Units, under the Corporate Banking Division, incorporate the following: ● Large Corporate (LC) Department ● Small & Medium Enterprises (SME) Department Business Divisions, responsible for retail lending operations, incorporate the following: ● Household Lending Division ● Small Business Lending Division The Risk Management Division (RMD) incorporates the following units handling credit risk: ● Credit Risk Department (CRD) ● Credit Control Department (CCD) ● Non–Performing Loans Department (NPL) 21 Annual Report 2013 Credit Control Department and Credit Risk Department are responsible for oversight of the Bank’s credit risk, including: ● Formulating credit policies in consultation with business units, covering collateral requirements, credit assessment, risk grading and reporting, documentary and legal procedures, and compliance with regulatory and statutory requirements. This task is performed by Credit Control Department. ● Credit Risk Department assesses all credit exposures in excess of designated limits, prior to facilities being committed to customers by the business unit concerned, and provides independent credit opinion. Renewals and reviews of facilities are subject to the same review process. ● Limiting concentrations of exposure to counterparties, countries and industries (for loans and advances), and by issuer, credit rating band and market liquidity (for investment securities). ●Developing and maintaining the Bank’s risk grading policy in order to categorize exposures according to the degree of risk of financial loss faced and to focus management on the attendant risks. The risk grading system is maintained by Credit Control Department. The risk grading system is used in determining where impairment allowance may be required against specific credit exposures. The current risk grading framework for wholesale placements consists of eleven grades and for retail exposures of fourteen grades (delinquency based) reflecting varying degrees of risk of default and the availability of collateral or other credit risk mitigation. Risk grades are subject to regular reviews. ●Reviewing compliance of business units with agreed exposure limits, including those for selected industries, country risk and product types is the responsibility of Credit Control Department. Regular reports are provided to various Bank bodies on the credit quality of portfolios and appropriate corrective action is taken. One of its main tasks is providing advice, guidance and specialist skills to business units to promote best practice throughout the Bank management credit risk. Each business unit is required to implement Bank’s credit policies and procedures, with credit approval authorities delegated from the Board of Directors. Each business unit is responsible for the quality and performance of its credit portfolio and for monitoring and controlling all credit risks in its portfolios, including those subject to central approval. The bank has developed and adopted a credit policy for each lending business unit. Each credit policy of Eurobank a.d. Beograd (hereinafter: the Credit Policy) defines basic concepts, guidelines and rules that ensure the proper management of the process of approving, disbursing, monitoring and collecting loans and other exposures. Credit Policy defines: ● the goals of the credit policy, ● the basic concepts of credit policy, ● lending principles, ● the organization of credit operations, ● responsibilities and decision making, ● the procedure for granting loans and other placements, 22 Annual Report 2013 ● credit risk, ● collateral instruments, ● procedures for collecting outstanding amounts. For the purposes of implementing the relevant Credit Policy, the Bank has also passed other necessary acts, decisions, rules, procedures, etc. When assuming credit risk, the Bank applies the following fundamental rules: A prerequisite for every financing transaction is the understanding of the economic background of the transaction. A loan is granted only when the Bank has sufficient information on the borrower’s creditworthiness. The Bank will not grant a loan (or increase an existing one) to a borrower who is unwilling or unable to provide sufficient information. Collateral is accepted only to support an exposure. It cannot serve as a substitute for the borrower’s ability to meet obligations (exception: Lombard loans, cash collateralized loans, etc.). The large and largest exposures towards any borrower (or group of connected borrowers), exposures towards connected persons as well as the total exposure of the Bank (both on and off-balance sheet), are kept within limits prescribed by the Law on Banks and relevant decisions of the National bank of Serbia. The Bank approves new loans or decides to extend or not to extend the existing ones based on creditworthiness of a client, as well as the details and characteristics of the transaction. All Bank credit facilities are based on relevant approvals, which lay down the terms and other conditions for their implementation. The approval levels and limits are defined by the relevant Board of Directors Decision on approval levels. For wholesale placements, there are 7 approval authority levels with the highest one being Board of Directors (or other nominated authority) in case of large exposures and exposures to related parties. For retail placements, there are also different approval levels depending on the type of business (consumer lending, mortgage lending or SBB lending), with the highest authority being specific Credit Commission for each business type. In each committee/commission, risk management has the right of vote. All decisions must be unanimous. In addition to a client’s creditworthiness, risk limits are also determined taking into account various collateral instruments. Risk exposure to individual borrower, including 23 Annual Report 2013 banks, is limited and includes both balance and off-balance sheet risk exposures. The total risk exposure per individual client (or group of related parties) with regards to the limits, is considered and analysed prior to completion of the transaction. In order to ensure the safety of the business operations, and based on the estimated risks of potential losses, the Bank calculates provisions, which arise from loans and off-balance sheet exposures. Levels of provision are related to the risk grade of the placement. Risk grading system for wholesale clients The 11–grade system, which derives the rating of the borrower (and not the credit facility), is based on the weighted average of the following risk parameters: ● Financials ● Sector ● Management ● Operations In addition, other factors such as debt servicing, change in the borrower’s ownership, etc., may affect the final rating of a customer. The credit rating is based on a profound analysis of qualitative and quantitative factors: Qualitative factors are those that deal with the borrower’s management, industry, operating conditions, etc. Quantitative factors are those that refer to a set of various ratios (main ratios: profitability, leverage, liquidity) emerging from the borrower’s financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, notes to financial statements etc.) Credit related commitments The primary purpose of undrawn credit commitments is to ensure that funds are available to a customer in accordance with the agreement. Guarantees and letter of credits carry the same credit risk as loans. 5.1.2. Impairment and provisioning policy Impaired loans and securities are loans and securities for which the Bank determines that it is probable that it will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan/securities agreement(s). Individually impaired assets are those which have been individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss has been recognized. For individually assessed accounts, loans are treated as impaired as soon as there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred. Accounts in portfolios of homogeneous loans are treated as impaired, once facilities are 90 days or more overdue for consumer and SBB placements, and 180 days or more overdue for mortgage placements. 24 Annual Report 2013 Past due but not impaired loans Loans and securities where contractual interest or principal payments are past due but the Bank believes that recognizing impairment loss is not appropriate on the basis of the level of security / collateral available and / or the stage of collection of amounts owed to the Bank. The term 'past due financial asset' is defined as '1–day delay'. That is when a counterparty has failed to make a payment when contractually due. The buckets used by the Bank for the purpose of this disclosure are: ● Consumer Lending: 1 – 89 days past due ● Mortgage: 1 – 179 days past due ● SBB: 1 – 89 days past due (loans for which specific provisions have been recognized are excluded) ● Corporate Lending: 1 – 359 days past due and internal grading score below eight (loans which have been recognized as individually impaired are excluded). Allowances for impairment The Bank establishes allowance for impairment losses that represents its estimate of incurred losses in its loan portfolio. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss components that relate to individually significant exposures, and a collective loan loss allowance established for groups of homogeneous assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but have not been identified on loans subject to individual assessment for impairment. Impairment of wholesale placements For exposures to borrowers with a rating of 8 or worse, NPV charge is calculated in accordance with IAS 39 requirements, depending on collateral and impairment analysis on “case by case” basis for the client. This charge is added up to the impairment calculated in accordance with the appropriate impairment rate and the sum represents total impairment. Impairment of retail placements The classification of retail clients is based on the full delinquency analysis. The required impairment is computed by applying the appropriate rate to the gross exposure per each product group and per each delinquency bucket. In case of individually impaired loans, future expected cash-flows are discounted in accordance with IAS 39 requirements, in order to arrive to appropriate level of impairment. Special reserve For both wholesale and retail placements, as per the regulatory requirements of the National Bank of Serbia, the Bank also calculates reserves for estimated losses as defined by the Decision on the Classification of Banks Balance Sheet Assets and Off-Balance Sheet Items, and other relevant regulations of the National Bank of Serbia. Write–off policy The Bank writes off a loan/security balance (and any related allowances for impairment losses) when it is determined that the loans/securities are uncollectible. This 25 Annual Report 2013 determination is reached after considering information such as the occurrence of significant changes in the borrower/issuer’s financial position such that the borrower/issuer can no longer pay the obligation, or if collateral is not sufficient enough to collect entire exposure. For unsecured retail loans, write–off decisions are generally based on a product specific past due status. Any write–off is approved by the relevant body in accordance with the decision of Board of Directors. 5.1.3. Collaterals For a majority of exposures, the Bank requires collateral. Collateral is not generally held over loans and advances to banks. Most often the collateral consists of one or more of the following collateral instruments (or instruments for credit support): ● cash deposits in dinars and foreign currencies, ● guarantees from the government, government funds or first class banks, ● guarantees from parent companies, other legal entities and individual persons, ● letters of comfort from parent companies, ● mortgage over real estate, ● pledge over movable property, ● own blank bills of exchange, ● pledge over shares or ownership stakes, ● a pledge over other securities (e.g. bonds) or precious metals, ● assignment of receivables (with or without notification) etc., ● assignment of insurance policies. The Bank reserves the right to request any other type of instruments (or variation of the above instruments) which it may deem necessary. Estimates of fair value are based on the value of collateral assessed at the time of borrowing, and are generally updated periodically in accordance with the relevant credit policy. 5.1.4. Credit monitoring The Bank constantly monitors the state of the borrower’s business and any change in its creditworthiness. To this end, besides the regular evaluation of financial statements, the responsible business units conducts regular checks of the borrower’s business operations. The monitoring of the borrower is institutionalized through regular credit reviews. Credit reviews are prepared by the relevant business unit and approved by the relevant approval authority. In case of wholesale customers, the review frequency depends on their risk grade. The Bank’s maximum exposure to credit risk is reflected in the carrying amounts of financial assets on the Balance sheet. For guarantees and commitments to extend credit, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount of the commitment. 26 Annual Report 2013 5.1.5. Loans and advances Loans and advances are summarized as follows: 31 December 2013 31 December 2012. Loans and advances Loans and Loans and advances Loans and to customers advances to banks to customers advances to banks Neither past due nor impaired 73,111,958 1,301,803 72,389,754 17,826,598 Past due but not impaired 8,203,875 – 7,104,122 – Impaired 17,843,182 – 16,026,708 – Total gross amount 99,159,015 1,301,803 95,520,584 17,826,598 a) Loans and advances neither past due nor impaired The credit quality of the portfolio of loans and advances that were neither past due nor impaired at 31 December 2013 can be assessed by reference to the Bank's standard grading system.

Market Risk The Bank takes on exposure to market risks, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general and specific movements and changes in the level of volatility of market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. 5.2.1. Foreign exchange risk Exposure to foreign currency risk is monitored on regular basis by complying with the requirements of the National Bank of Serbia. The Bank manages its foreign currency position by granting loans that are indexed to foreign currency. The Bank also actively manages the foreign currency risk by careful estimation of the open foreign currency positions and compliance with the risk ratios prescribed by the National Bank of Serbia as well as the limits prescribed in the internal acts enacted by the Bank’s management and Risk Management Committee. The Bank uses scenario analysis for measurement of FX risk. 31 Annual Report 2013 5.2.2. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the exposure of bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates. Generally, there are two ways in which the bank could be affected by changes in interest rates. Firstly, changes in interest rates affect the value of banks assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, and secondly, they impact the bank's future cash flows that the bank will obtain. Interest rate risk could come in the variety of forms, including reprising risk, yield curve risk, basis and optionality risk. The Bank’s interest rates are set by taking into account the market interest rates and other factors (such as the cost of risk, reserve requirement, etc.) and the Bank regularly adjusts them. The purpose of the interest rate management activities is to optimize the net interest income, and to maintain the interest margins on a consistent level in accordance with the Bank’s business strategy. The management is based on maturities matching of the assets, liabilities and off balance sheet items, on the basis of: macro and micro economic estimations, estimations of the conditions for achieving liquidity, and the estimation of the interest rates’ trends. For the purpose of measurement of interest rate risk, Bank uses sensitivity analysis by applying duration-based sensitivity weights, followed with stress tests incorporating various changes in interest rate variables. The Bank manages interest rate risk through a set of interest rate exposure limits. 5.2.3. Sensitivity analysis The management of interest rate risk and currency risk against gap limits is supplemented by monitoring the sensitivity of the Bank’s income statements to various interest rate and foreign currency rate scenarios. The sensitivity of the income statement is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates and FX rate on the net interest income for one year. An analysis of the Bank’s sensitivity to an increase or decrease in market interest rates and FX rates (assuming no asymmetrical movements in yield curves and constant balance sheet position) is as follows: Sensitivity of income statement Interest rate sensitivity 2013 2012 Increase in basis points (73,048) (257,385) +100 bps parallel shift Foreign exchange sensitivity 68,060 (884) 10% depreciation of RSD 32 Annual Report 2013 5.3. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk when the Bank is unable to meet its payment obligations which can have a negative result on the Bank’s financial results and equity. The Bank manages liquidity risk by obtaining different funding sources that include: ● customer’s deposits with different maturities ● deposits from the money market and available lines with financial institution ● available lines form the majority shareholder ● available lines from international financial institutions ● share capital Sources of liquidity are regularly reviewed so as to maintain a wide diversification by currency, geography, provider, product and term. The matching and controlled mismatching of the maturities and interest rates of assets and liabilities is fundamental to the Management of the Bank. It is unusual for banks to be completely matched, as transacted business is often of uncertain term and of different types. An unmatched position potentially enhances profitability, but also increases the risk of losses. The maturities of assets and liabilities and the ability to replace, at an acceptable cost, interest–bearing liabilities as they mature, are important factors in assessing the liquidity of the Bank and its exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates. Diversity and stability of core deposit base involves an analysis allowing the Bank to more effectively control and measure deposit based liquidity and more accurately measure liquidity risk by defining deposit inputs. Liquidity requirements to support claim under guarantees and standby letters of credit are considerably less than the amount of the commitment because the Bank does not generally expect the third party to draw funds under the agreement. The total outstanding contractual amount of commitments to extend credit does not necessarily represent future cash requirements, as many of these commitments will expire or terminate without being funded. Liquidity risk measurement includes assessment of the risk under normal market conditions and under stress scenarios. Scenarios, which are defined based on historical data and case studies, should allow the Bank to evaluate the potential adverse impact these factors can have on its liquidity position. Liquidity risk is monitored through a set of short term limits. Following NBS methodology, the Bank has defined minimum level of liquidity expressed as short–term liquidity ratio. For internal methodology purposes, limit framework includes ratios as a limit definition of acceptable levels of short–term liquidity mismatches. 33 Annual Report 2013 Non – derivative cash flow The amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows for the years 2013 and 2012. a) Balance sheet items Over 5 As at 31 December 2013 Up to 1 month 1–3 months 3–12 months 1–5 years Total years Transaction and other deposits 46,119,175 12,458,909 45,363,643 2,793,486 – 106,735,213 Borrowings 12,928 140,470 4,176,899 2,746,506 25,418 7,102,221 Other liabilities 390,214 – – – – 390,214 Total liabilities (contractual 46,522,317 12,599,379 49,540,542 5,539,992 25,418 114,227,648 maturity dates) Assets held for managing liquidity 56,164,932 913,072 21,387,026 37,521,849 36,078,201 152,065,080 risk (contractual maturity dates) Over 5 As at 31 Decembar 2012 Up to 1 month 1–3 months 3–12 months 1–5 years Total years Transaction and other deposits 33,392,907 8,858,641 50,083,864 1,656,428 – 93,991,840 Borrowings 170,853 341,707 1,566,155 27,651,817 681,881 30,412,413 Other liabilities 318,958 – – – – 318,958 Total liabilities 33,882,718 9,200,348 51,650,019 29,308,245 681,881 124,723,211 (contractual maturity dates) Assets held for managing liquidity 55,728,969 17,226,356 42,592,525 25,674,787 21,973,689 163,196,326 risk (contractual maturity dates) 34 Annual Report 2013 b) Off–balance sheet items As at 31 December 2013 No later than 1 year 1–5 years Over 5 years Total Loan commitments 3,730,941 4,403,375 924,393 9,058,709 Guarantees and acceptances 1,919,897 4,018,555 8,233,548 14,172,000 Other irrevocable commitments 277,157 618,723 – 895,880 Operating lease 80,502 – – 80,502 Capital commitments 70,583 – – 70,583 Total 6,079,080 9,040,653 9.157.941 24,277,674 As at 31 Decembar 2012 No later than 1 year 1–5 years Over 5 years Total Loan commitments 3,783,926 5,807,192 1,025,766 10,616,884 Guarantees and acceptances 1,589,640 6,849,835 10,822,979 19,262,454 Other irrevocable commitments 981,107 627,253 – 1,608,360 Operating lease 114,554 78,938 104,671 298,163 Capital commitments 20,532 – – 20,532 Total 6,489,759 13,363,218 11,953,416 31,806,393 35 Annual Report 2013 Derivative cash flow The Bank’s derivatives that are settled on gross basis include foreign exchange swaps over–the–counter (OTC).

Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of negative effects on the financial result and capital of the bank caused by human error, inadequate internal procedures and processes, inadequate management of the information system and other systems in the bank, as well as by unforeseeable external events. Part of this risk is legal risk, arising from bank’s failure to comply with the legal or contractual provisions, negatively affecting the operations or status of the Bank. 36 Annual Report 2013 They are monitored per business lines and per operational loss event types, and regularly reviewed in order to take corrective actions where necessary. 5.5. Capital management The Bank maintains an actively managed capital base to cover risk inherent to the business. The Bank’s objectives, when managing capital which is a broader concept than “equity” on the face of the balance sheet, are: ● To comply with the capital requirements set by the National Bank of Serbia ● To provide an adequate level of capital so as to enable the Bank to continue its operations as a going concern ● To maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business. Capital adequacy, as well as the use of the Bank’s capital are monitored on a monthly basis by the Bank’s management. The National Bank of Serbia has defined the following capital limits: ● The minimum amount of the capital of EUR 10 million ● Capital adequacy ratio of 12% The Bank’s total capital comprises of tier 1 and tier 2 capital and deductible items. Tier 1 capital: share capital from ordinary shares, share premium, statutory reserves and retained loss. Tier 1 deductible items comprise intangible assets and regulatory adjustments i.e. required reserve for estimated losses as prescribed by relevant NBS regulations. Tier 2 capital: share capital from preference shares, share premium from preference shares, part of positive revaluation reserves arising from effects of changes in fair value of fixed assets, securities and other assets, hybrid capital instruments up to 35% of tier I capital, subordinated debt up to 50% of tier 1 capital, and acquired own preference shares as Tier 2 capital deductible items. Deductible items: direct or indirect investments in banks or other financial institutions in excess of 10% of the capital of these banks or other entities, the amount of the tier 2 capital of the bank which exceeds its tier 1 capital and other items. Deductions are subtracted from the capital in following manner: 50% of the total amount of deductible items is deducted from the Tier II capital and the rest of the Tier I capital. The risk–weighted balance and off–balance assets are determined in accordance with the prescribed risk ratios for all types of assets. When calculating the capital adequacy ratio, and in accordance with the regulations of the National Bank of Serbia, the overall risk-weighted balance and off–balance assets are increased for the calculated foreign currency and price risk. The table below summarizes the structure of the Bank’s capital as at 31 December 2013, as well as the capital adequacy ratio: 37 Annual Report 2013 2013 2012 TIER 1 capital 39,335,684 39,403,148 Tier 1 deductible items (20,224,874) (16,669,633) TIER II capital 189,991 155,131 Deductible items Investments in shares over 10% (20,479) (20,479) Total regulatory capital 19,280,322 22,868,167 Risk–weighted assets Credit and counterparty risk 85,118,297 87,416,932 Market risk 1,483,670 657,979 Operational risk 12,347,286 12,837,721 Total risk–weighted assets 98,949,253 100,912,632 Capital adequacy 19.5% 22.7% 5.6. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. A market price, where an active market (such as a recognized stock exchange) exists, is the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument. However, market prices are not available for a significant number of financial assets and liabilities held by the Bank. Therefore, for financial instruments where no market price is available, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities are estimated by using present value of future cash flows or other estimation and valuation techniques based on current prevailing market conditions. The values derived from using these techniques are significantly affected by underlying assumptions concerning both the amounts and timing of future cash flows and the discount rates used. The following methods and assumptions indicate that the fair values of financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts: a) Trading assets, derivatives and other transactions undertaken for trading purposes as well as treasury bills, available–for–sale securities and assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value by reference to quoted market prices when available. If quoted market prices are not available, then the fair values are estimated by using valuation techniques based on observable market data. b) Therefore, all of the Bank's other financial assets and liabilities are at floating rates of interest, which re–price at pre–defined intervals. Therefore the Bank has no significant exposure to fair value fluctuations and the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities is substantially equivalent to their fair values, unless otherwise stated. 38 Annual Report 2013 5.6.1. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value a) Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources; unobservable inputs reflect the Bank’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: ● Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; ● Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); ● Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). 31 December 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Equities (Note 22) 12,995 – – 12,995 Treasury bonds – 8,702 – 8,702 Derivative assets – 32,046 – 32,046 Financial assets available for sale – Frozen bonds (Note 22) 9,985,866 – – 9,985,866 Equities (Note 22) 68,353 – – 68,353 Treasury bonds – 4,630,120 – 4,630,120 Total assets 10,067,214 4,670,868 – 14,738,082 Derivative liabilities (Note 20) – 32,785 – 32,785 Total liabilities – 32,785 – 32,785 39 Annual Report 2013 31 Deccember 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Equities (Note 22) 13,093 – – 13,093 Derivative assets (Note 20) – 48,047 – 48,047 Financial assets available for sale Frozen bonds (Note 22) 8,870,806 – – 8,870,806 Equities (Note 22) 6,586 – – 6,586 Treasury bonds (Note 22) – 3,825,477 – 3,825,477 Total assets 8,890,485 3,873,524 – 12,764,009 Derivative liabilities (Note 20) – 49,284 – 49,284 Total liabilities – 49,284 – 49,284 Total liabilities The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Bank is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1. 40 Annual Report 2013 6.

Related–parties transactions Eurobank a.d. Beograd is a subsidiary of Eurobank Ergasias which is listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. EFG Group was the controlling shareholder of the Eurobank Ergasias S.A., holding 44.70% of the Eurobank’s ordinary shares and voting rights until 23 July 2012. In May 2013, following its full subscription in Eurobank’s recapitalisation of € 5,839 million, the HFSF became the controlling shareholder and a related party of Eurobank. On 19 June 2013, the HFSF acquired 3,789,317,358 Eurobank’s ordinary shares with voting rights, representing 98.56% of its ordinary share capital. Following the issuance of 205,804,664 new ordinary 74 Annual Report 2013 shares in July, as resolved at the Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders on 27 June 2013, the percentage of the voting rights held in Eurobank by the HFSF decreased to 93.55%. Following the share capital increase approved by the Extraordinary General Meeting on 26 August 2013, the controlling percentage of the HFSF increased to 95.23%. Eurobank Ergasias Group regards other Greek Banks as controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by the HFSF, within the context of the Greek Banks' recapitalization, as well as the members of key management personnel of the HFSF, as related parties. Eurobank Ergasias Group’s transactions with HFSF's related Greek banks are made in the ordinary course of business, carried out in compliance with the market terms and not influenced by the HFSF as the controlling shareholder of the Bank and not included in the related–party transactions presented. National Bank of Greece S.A. (NBG) Voluntary Tender Offer (VTO) and merger On 15 February 2013, the National Bank of Greece SA (NBG) acquired 84.35% of Eurobank’s voting shares following the completion of a Voluntary Tender Offer (VTO) launched on 11 January 2013. The VTO would have been followed by the merger of the two banks, the process of which initiated on 19 March 2013. On 28 March 2013, BoG sent letters to all viable banks, including Eurobank Ergasias S.A. and NGB, stating that each bank should proceed with its recapitalization by the end of April 2013 requesting them to proceed with the relevant necessary actions. On 7 April 2013, as the joint banks’ request for the extension of the recapitalization process up to 20 June 2013 was not granted, the relevant regulatory authorities with the consent of the management of both banks decided that the Eurobank and NBG would be independently recapitalized in full. As a consequence, the merger process of the two banks was suspended. In this respect, the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders of Eurobank Ergasias S.A., convened on 30 April 2013, opted for the increase of the Eurobank’s ordinary share capital, in order to raise € 5,839 million, subscribed by way of contribution in kind from the HFSF, in accordance with Law 3864/2010 and Act of Cabinet 38/9.11.2012. As a result of the above mentioned share capital increase of the Bank, the percentage of the voting rights held by NBG as at 30 September 2013 was reduced below 5%.
