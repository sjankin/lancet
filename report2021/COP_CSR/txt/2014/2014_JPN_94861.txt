In Kyoto, where our head office is located, there are many long-standing companies with a history of 100 years or more. From these pioneers, I am learning day by day that it is important to disseminate management philosophy, invest in human resources and technologies to be invulnerable to economic downturns, continuously create innovation inspired by “venture spirit,” have a spirit of challenge without being satisfied with the status quo, win the trust of customers and enhance long-term value to run the business in harmony with society. In 2013, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of our foundation. I see this as one way point, and we will strive to further enhance our corporate value.

HORIBA Report 2013 | 08 Message from the CEO Continuing to invest in human resources and technologies HORIBA is promoting management that clarifies “what we will change” and “what we will never change” practices we learned by overcoming several economic crises in the past. A major target of “what we will change” that we are currently tackling is management balance. By diversifying businesses, regions and transaction currencies, we are becoming an organization that can maintain the level of investment for the future even if one or two of our businesses or regions enter a downturn. The recent increase in the global market share of the Semiconductor Instruments & Systems segment, where market conditions fluctuate dramatically, is a good example of this. On the other hand, an example of “what we will never change” is our continued investment in “Invisible Values” (assets not visible in the financial statements) such as human resources 01 02 and technologies. Such continued investment will become the driving force in expanding global market share when demand recovers, and this has been proven by results many times in our history. We have adopted various creative measures to enable us to secure human resources with abundant diversity, such as the introduction of recruitment of new graduates in autumn and the continual recruitment of students from overseas, as well as building up the number of available courses at the HORIBA COLLEGE, which provides educational opportunities to our employees. Moreover, in 2014, we initiated a corporate project aimed at further enhancing diversity. It is called the “HORIBA Stained Glass Project” and it develops a working environment where everyone in diverse human resources can shine at their best. Aiming to be a truly global company with a unique 05 06 corporate culture The companies that HORIBA has acquired are all globally respected companies that boast excellent technologies, human resources and histories. I am convinced that these companies have grown together with HORIBA firstly because the people that have become our new associates deeply Changes in the management structure understand our unique corporate culture symbolized by the company motto “Joy and Fun,” which enables us to share Measures taken so far Omoi (meaning an emotional feeling, passion, commitment, mission and objective) and secondary because HORIBA has Changed the corporate name and unified our corporate brand consistently practiced management that values this principle. Introduced “Matrix Management” In 2004, we announced the concept of “HORIBA Group is Restructured group companies in the Americas and Europe, and One Company.” and promoted changes in policies and organized development bases systems such as the unification of the company name and Introduced “Shared services*” in the U.S., Japan and the U.K. brand, the invigoration of personnel exchanges among group companies, and the introduction of “Segment and Matrix Enhanced head office function Management.” At the same time, to enhance communication Expanded the Blackjack Project** globally between executive and employees, we hold and host birthday Initiated the HORIBA COLLEGE parties every month in various places in Japan. Furthermore, we actively create opportunities for face to face communication on a global basis. This corporate culture fosters the “Invisible Values” of human resources and 09 technologies, and we ultimately provide these “Invisible Values” to customers in the form of real “products and services” that have enabled the creation of our current corporate value. We are indeed proud that all the business activities we conduct are contributing to the realization of a comfortable and sustainable society, and this is also the basic concept of our Corporate Social Responsibility. HORIBA is not just another Japanese company that conducts business around the world. Rather, our objective is to be a truly global company with an understanding of the diverse culture, customs, and values of the countries and regions where we conduct business in harmony with the local community and employees. We have also signed the United Nations Global Compact, a set of universally accepted 03 04 principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption that the United Nations advocates, and 01 Dr. Kozo Ishida we are monitoring our activities from the perspective of global Executive Vice Chairman standards. 02 Atsushi Horiba Based on these initiatives and sustainable profit growth, I Chairman, President & CEO firmly believe we will consequently receive a fair market 03 Juichi Saito valuation from investors around the world as a true global Executive Vice President and General Manager of Corporate & Segment company.

The earnings statement and balance sheet both embody visible and important values. However, we believe that the essence of good management is to increase “Invisible Values” which are firmly rooted in corporate culture. Management’s emphasis on maximizing short-term earnings will not foster sustainable growth or an increase in corporate value; these two objectives cannot be achieved if there is neglect to invest in Invisible Values. Diverse human Continual investment resources attracted to HORIBA’s Omoi Human regardless of economic upturns and downturns resources Brands Technologies Creation of incremental corporate value Responding Focus on analytical scrupulously to and measurement customers’ needs technologies Customers Organizational structure Practice of “Joy and Fun” 27 At HORIBA, employees are considered to be not simply “employees” but Human “human resources” in the sense of resources that are assets. In order for all resources employees to achieve self-realization through “Joy and Fun”, we have set forth, shared, and been striving to realize HORIBA’s five Omoi shown below. HORIBA’s strong organizational power is generated from the compelling desire of all highly-diversified HORIBA employees to practice HORIBA’s five Omoi. 1. To be a part of a collaborative community, at the forefront of new ideas and creations. 2. To achieve goals and making my life memorable by fostering the highest intellectual potential. HORIBA’s 3. To reach across the globe to expand learning that captures key business developments, wherever they occur. five Omoi 4. To be proud of sharing what I do and what HORIBA delivers. 5. I want to participate all around and where I can be of help. Technological development is the most important growth driver that will Technologies enable HORIBA to achieve the Mid-Long Term Management Plan［[2011-2015]］ targets: ¥150 billion in consolidated net sales and an operating income ratio of 13% or more. We firmly believe that technical development is the lifeline of a manufacturer such as HORIBA. To make an analogy, technical capability is a form of basic physical fitness, which cannot be maintained without continual training and exercise. Using this analogy, we need to keep training in order to maintain the power to make a dash forward in a recovery phase of the economy. HORIBA operates five businesses in 26 countries. We believe it is important Organizational that our human resources in each business and each region take the initiative structure in promoting their business and that we have the cohesive power to sustain HORIBA as an integrated group. With that aim, we are spreading our “Joy and Fun” corporate culture into our global group-wide organization and promoting “One Company Matrix Management.” HORIBA helps improve people’s quality of life in a sustainable society by Customers supplying products and providing services to customers. We think it is important to provide solutions in addition to supplying hardware (instruments). In order to achieve this goal, we collaborate with suppliers and group companies in Japan and overseas to improve the quality of our products and services. HORIBA works on growing “Invisible Values”, such as human resources, Brands technologies, and its corporate culture, while achieving numerical targets for net sales, profits, and other indicators. “Invisible Values” are essential in generating future earnings and enabling enterprise continuity. We believe that these efforts are reflected in raising the value of the HORIBA brands. HORIBA Report 2013 | 28 Value creation based on invisible values Human resources Regardless of economic upturns and downturns, HORIBA has consistently invested in human resources, which are precious “Invisible Values”. What lays the foundation for sustainable value creation is the understanding each HORIBA employee has of our corporate motto “Joy and Fun” and a corporate culture that is symbolized by ”open and fair” and “entrepreneurial spirit,” and puts this heritage into practice at work.

At our new HORIBA BIWAKO E-HARBOR, we will work at improving the time-to-market of new products and efficiency of production by an organic integration of development, design, and production. When we carried out a reorganization in 2011, we combined the gas measurement businesses in the Automotive Test Systems and Process & Environmental Instruments & Systems segments at HORIBA, Ltd. Combining these groups allows us to speed up the development process and improve our ability to meet customer requirements. The amount of investment planned is on the order of ¥10 billion, the largest amount we have ever invested at a single location at one time. Construction is to be completed in autumn of 2015. A new global pacesetter among manufacturing facilities At this new location, in the same place where HORIBA originated, we will take a giant step forward in integrating design, development, production, sales operations, and post-sales services. We will introduce a new manufacturing method by organically combining design, development, and production, with the aim of responding to different customer needs in Japan where we have the expertise and accumulated know-how based on our strength in core technology. Production capacity will be doubled, and delivery time will be reduced to a third, resulting in enhanced competitiveness. We will install analytic and testing equipment for gas measurement equipment for Automotive Test Systems and Process & Environmental Instruments & Systems segments use. In addition to development of applications, we will be able to provide clients with training services and demonstrations. The location, on the west shore of Lake Biwa, is adjacent to our logistics center, reducing logistic cost. By bringing together design, development, production, sales functions, and post-sales services at a single site, HORIBA’s creativity, quality assurance, technology and know-how will be available to serve customers on a global scale. Ensuring our technological legacy Transferring the accumulated core technology HORIBA has acquired in its first 60 years of existence to each new generation of engineers and technical personnel is vital in order for us to improve and grow. With this knowledge transfer, we intend to provide an undying driver of technological innovation. HORIBA Ltd.

Rendering of HORIBA BIWAKO E-HARBOR HORIBA Report 2013 | 32 Corporate governance Corporate Governance Philosophy Appointment of outside director and auditor To avoid managing with an introverted approach, HORIBA has always appointed at least one director and one auditor from outside the company. This practice started with the company’s origin in 1953 and has been continued through to the present day. HORIBA’s outside director and two outside auditors qualify as independent, as specified by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, because their current posts and backgrounds indicate that they have little risk of having conflict of interests with general shareholders and can maintain independence between their current duties and past careers. Implementing shareholder return linked to earnings growth HORIBA was the first listed Japanese company to start paying shareholder dividends based on a predetermined payout ratio in 1974 when HORIBA was listed in the Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Since 2013, HORIBA has changed the base amount of profit returns to shareholders (the combined amount of dividend payments and share buybacks) from 30% of nonconsolidated net income to 30% of consolidated net income, so that shareholder returns are more directly linked to consolidated performance. Open general meetings of shareholders Since its initial stock listing in the Second Section of the Osaka Securities Exchange in 1971, HORIBA has encouraged all shareholders (whom it frequently calls owners) to attend the annual General Shareholders Meeting. These meetings are held on Saturdays to facilitate public attendance. An informal get-together event is held afterwards to enable shareholders to talk directly with the management. Adoption of a corporate officer system Since 2005, HORIBA has limited the number of directors to five members to prevent the Board of Directors meetings from becoming inflexible and to promote lively, in-depth discussion. In April 2014, the Board was increased by one member to six directors to strengthen company management. In addition, HORIBA introduced a corporate officer system in 1998 to make decisions at the Board meetings more prompt and augment managerial capability. At present, HORIBA has 16 corporate officers including Dr. Jai Hakhu, who joined HORIBA in 2010 and now serves as a head of HORIBA’s U.S. operations. Directors: 6 Directors: 9 (including 1 outside member) 1997 (including 2 outside members) 2014 Corporate officers: 16 (including 1 non-Japanese) The first female to be a corporate officer at HORIBA In 2014, for the first time since its foundation, the female corporate officer was appointed at HORIBA.

By this, HORIBA means it aspires to become a valuable company to everyone. HORIBA Group CSR Policy Promoting CSR through operations Based on its commitments to energy, human health, the environment and safety, HORIBA will pursue corporate initiatives to contribute to the realization of “a life of content for all.” We formed the HORIBA Group CSR Promotion Committee in April 2005 in order to promote group-wide CSR activities. The committee, which is chaired by Dr. Kozo Ishida, Executive Vice Chairman of HORIBA, Ltd. and participated in by four directors in charge of CSR at the four group companies in Japan, decides on CSR policy and priority measures. Each of the group companies has its own CSR Promotion Committee where the policy and measures decided by the HORIBA Group CSR Promotion Committee are implemented, and our social contributions concerning education, the environment, local communities, and other areas are compiled and reported. Signed the United Nations Global Compact In agreement with the ten principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption, which the Global Compact (GC) of the United Nations sets forth for companies within their sphere of influence, HORIBA declared its concurrence to the UN’s policy initiative in April 2011. Actions taken to date in connection with the policy initiative are shown on the following page. In addition, we have joined the Global Compact Japan Network and is actively involved in committee work in the organization. This is one more way whereby we are engaged in activities needed and useful to society. Integrated Management System (IMS) To provide customers with high-quality reliable products, HORIBA has adopted the IMS*, which is a combination of the Quality Management Systems ISO9001, Quality Environmental Management Systems ISO14001, and Occupational Health & Management Systems for Safety Management System OHSAS18001. With this, we became the first Medical Devices Japanese company in the analysis and measurement industry to acquire the JQA Group (ISO 13485) IMS Quality Integrated Management System Certifications (JQA-IG0001-08) as Group IMS Management Systems (ISO9001) from the Japan Quality Assurance Organization, or JQA. In February 2014, we also acquired certification for ISO22301, the international Business standard for Business Continuity Management Systems, in the medical area, Continuity Management which is directly related to human life, and established a system that can supply Systems (ISO22301) stable number of products even in the wake of an earthquake, accident, or various Occupational Environmental Health & Safety diverse risk events.

Financial instruments (1) Overview of financial instruments Management policy HORIBA carries out fund management with an emphasis on security and procures funds mainly through bank borrowings and bond issuances. Derivatives are used to manage foreign exchange fluctuation risk and interest rate fluctuation risk, and it is HORIBA's policy not to engage in speculative transactions. Financial instruments, risks and risk management Notes receivable and accounts receivable, which are operating receivables, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. HORIBA endeavors to reduce this risk by conducting due date control and balance control and by attempting to promptly recognize collection concerns stemming from such factors as a deterioration in the financial condition of a customer. Most notes payable and accounts payable, which are operating payables, have payment due dates within one year. Some operating receivables and payables are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuation risk. However, HORIBA endeavors to reduce this risk by offsetting foreign currency denominated operating receivables and payables and by using forward exchange contracts, etc. Marketable securities are mainly short-term investments with high liquidity such as negotiable deposits. Investment securities are mainly shares of companies that have a business relationships with HORIBA and are exposed to market value fluctuation risk. However, when acquiring or selling shares of a certain value, the Board of Directors considers the details of the transactions and HORIBA endeavors to reduce any risk by ensuring that the market value information regarding the shares is reported to the management team in a timely manner. Short-term loans are mainly for financing related to operating transactions, while long-term loans and corporate bonds are mainly for financing related to plant and equipment and working capital. Trade liabilities and loans are exposed to liquidity risk, but HORIBA endeavors to reduce this risk by using methods such as the preparation of cash flow plans. Regarding derivative transactions, in addition to conducting exchange agreement transactions within the limit of the balance of foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables, HORIBA conducts forward exchange agreement transactions for the expected foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables, which would be generated with certainty by scheduled export or import trading. HORIBA conducts interest rate swap transactions aimed at avoiding interest rate fluctuation risk within the limit of the balance of borrowings. HORIBA's policy is not to engage in speculative transactions. Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments The market value of financial instruments includes values based on market prices and amounts rationally calculated when there are no market prices available. As HORIBA incorporates variable factors when making these calculations, the amounts may change due to the adoption of different assumptions. With regard to contract amounts related to derivative transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements item Derivative transactions, the amounts do not indicate the market risk associated with derivative transactions themselves.

Assets (1) Cash and time deposits and (2) Trade notes and accounts receivable As these are settled in the short term, market value approximates book value and is, therefore, based on the applicable book value. (3) Marketable securities and investment securities Market value for these is based on prices on securities exchanges in the case of shares, etc. For bonds, market value is based on prices on securities exchanges or prices indicated by corresponding financial institutions. For marketable securities classified by the purpose for which they are held, see Note 5. Liabilities (1) Trade notes and accounts payable, (2) Short-term loans, (3) Accounts payable other and (4) Accrued income taxes As these are settled in the short term, market value approximates book value and is, therefore, based on the applicable book value. (5) Bonds Market value for bonds issued by HORIBA is calculated based on market prices. (6) Long-term loans Borrowings based on variable interest rates reflect market interest rates, and as the creditworthiness of HORIBA has not changed significantly since execution, market value is considered to be approximate book value and is, therefore, based on applicable book value. The value of borrowings with fixed interest rates is based on the total amount of principal and interest discounted at an interest rate of a similar new loan. Derivative transactions See Note 14 for derivative transactions. Net receivables (payables) derived from derivative transactions are displayed in the table above. Total net payables are shown in parenthesis. Note 2. The following table summarizes financial instruments whose fair value was extremely difficult to estimate.

HORIBA Report 2013 | 66 Financial data HORIBA, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries | Note to Consolidated Financial Statements 10. Net assets Under Japanese laws and regulations, the entire amount paid for new shares is required to be designated as common stock. However, a company may, by a resolution of the Board of Directors, designate an amount not exceeding one half of the price of the new shares as additional paid-in capital, which is included in capital surplus. Under the Japanese Corporate Law ( the Law ), in cases where a dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve must be set aside as additional paid-in capital or legal earnings reserve. Legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve may not be distributed as dividends. Under the Law, all additional paid-in capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends. Both of these appropriations generally require a resolution of the shareholder's meeting. The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the nonconsolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with Japanese laws and regulations. At the Board of Directors' meeting held on February 13, 2014, the Board of Directors approved cash dividends in the amount of \1,776 million ($16,851 thousand). The appropriation had not been accrued in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013. Such appropriations are recognized in the period in which they are approved by the Board of Directors. 11.

Stock price volatility was calculated based on actual weekly stock prices over 15 years (from the week of May 4, 1998 to the week of April 29, 2013). Note 2. As it was difficult to estimate the expected remaining period without sufficient relevant data, it was determined to be exercised at the mid-point of the exercise period. Note 3. Expected dividend was calculated by using the actual dividend paid for the year ended December 31, 2012. Note 4. Risk free interest rate represents the comparable compound interest rate of strip government bonds whose remaining period corresponds to the expected remaining period of the stock options. (4) Condition regarding the estimate of the fair unit value of stock options Retirement from the office of director is a condition to exercise stock options, but continuous employment is not.

Impairment loss HORIBA reviewed its long-lived assets for impairment, and, as a result, impairment losses were recognized by the Company for the following asset groups as other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012. Location Use Type Millions of yen Machinery and equipment Montpellier, France Idle Other equipment ¥104 Neuhausen, Germany Goodwill 21 Kyoto, Japan Idle Land 8 (Background) In the case of idle assets, there was no concrete plan to use the assets for business. In the case of goodwill, income that HORIBA had assumed in the business plan that it considered at the time of stock acquisition was no longer projected. Thus, the book value of these assets was lowered to the recoverable value, and the resulting impairment loss was recognized as other expenses. (Method used for grouping) In connection with the use of impairment accounting, business assets are grouped on a reporting segment basis. Idle assets which are not expected to be used in the future are grouped on a property-by-property basis. (Method used for calculating a recoverable amount) The recoverable amount for idle assets was measured according to estimated net realizable value. As it is difficult to sell or divert machinery and equipment and other equipment elsewhere, the recoverable amount was estimated at zero, while the recoverable amount for land was estimated based on publicly announced market values for land. Furthermore, in regard to goodwill, the unamortized balance for which it was acknowledged that income was unlikely to be obtained in the future was recognized as an impairment loss.

Segment information General information regarding reportable segments (1) Calculation method for reportable segments HORIBA's reportable segments are components of the Company about which separate financial information is available and that are evaluated regularly by the management in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has established the segment strategy office for each product and service at its headquarters which draws a comprehensive plan for Japan and overseas markets for business development. The Company thus is composed of business segments by product and service that are determined at the head office. The Automotive Test Systems, Process & Environmental Instruments & Systems, Medical-Diagnostic Instruments & Systems, Semiconductor Instruments & Systems and Scientific Instruments & Systems comprise five reportable segments. Major products of each segment are described below. (a) Automotive Test Systems Emission Measurement Systems, In-Use Automotive Emissions Analyzers, On-Board Emission Measurement, Driveline Test Systems, Engine Test Systems, Brake Test Systems, Drive Recorders (b) Process & Environmental Instruments & Systems Environmental Measuring Instruments (Stack Gas Analyzers, Water Quality Analysis and Examination Systems, Air Pollution Analyzers), Environmental Radiation Monitors (c) Medical-Diagnostic Instruments & Systems Equipment for Blood Sample Analysis (Hematology Analyzers, Equipment for Measuring Immunological Responses, Clinical Chemistry Analyzers, Blood Sugar Measurement Systems) (d) Semiconductor Instruments & Systems Mass Flow Controllers, Chemical Concentration Monitors, Reticle/Mask Particle Detection Systems, Residual Gas Analyzers (e) Scientific Instruments & Systems Scientific Analysis Instruments (pH Meters, Particle-Size Distribution Analyzers, X-Ray Fluorescence Analyzers, Raman, Spectrophotometers, Diffraction, Gratings) (2) Method of measurement regarding income (loss), assets and other material items by reportable segment The accounting methods applied for reportable segments are identical with those stated in Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies.
