With this communication, we express our intent to advance those principles within our sphere of influence.

Atea has a particular focus on the environment and ensuring that the company's operations should have as little environmental impact as possible, and is focused on being a good front runner by offering solutions that the company itself has adopted and which provides added value in relation to corporate social responsibility, as well. The annual report contains a separate statement concerning the company's guidelines and measures related to corporate social responsibility Pg. 02 Introduction Objective and measures Atea's objective is to maintain the solid work and the results achieved in relation to environmental work, by the company itself and in collaboration with its customers. The existing solutions are continuously being improved and offered to customers as part of the portfolio. CDP reports and footprint reports are to be followed up on, and internal projects, including One Infrastructure, completed. One challenge which Atea has to face is the fact that the company does not produce any products itself, and the company is, therefore, to some degree dependent on its suppliers, in their own interest, living up to the code of ethics. Atea’s objective, therefore, is to constantly ensure that suppliers have their own guidelines and that these are followed. The largest international suppliers are at the forefront of efforts to ensure sound ethical guidelines within their ranks. One important focus point for Atea is to ensure that smaller suppliers follow international regulations and that they confirm this by signing the Atea declaration. Internally, procedures will be established to have senior employees sign that they understand and perform their work in accordance with, the current code of ethics. In 2014, therefore, work continues on implementation of revised ethical guidelines and specific measures for monitoring, among other things through written commitment from senior management internally, and by way of a supplier’s declaration regarding ethical standards externally. Pg. 03 Letter of Commitment Letter of Commitment Pg. 04 Human Rights Human Rights Social Commitment Atea is engaged in measures to fight poverty and to give children an opportunity for an education and a good life. The company supports several organizations with such aims, and also carries out its own projects to collect donations. Atea Global Services (AGS) operates from the Baltics. To help local present challenges AGS had during 2013 several activities related to supporting children and youngsters from orphanages. AGS invited children from local orphanages to show what the daily life of AGS looks like, how different the people employed there are differences in nationalities, skills, tasks they do and to show the children the range of possibilities and that everyone can find something suitable through education. In Finland, Atea helped poor families by donating to the Christmas Spirit Campaign, organized by Red Cross and the Mannerheim League for Child Welfare. The money collected was used to give 70-euro food vouchers to 20,000 poor Finnish families at Christmas time. In a more international scale Atea aided the victims of the Philippines typhoon through economical donations. During 2013, Atea continued their support of schools and education of children in Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso and Nepal. The projects were helped through Save the Children. The girls’ school in Sierra Leone doubled the number of students with Atea’s help during 2013 and do now have 240 students. In Nepal, more than 500 students and teachers were supported by Atea’s program. Highlights (incl. measurements of outcome) • We have helped with renovation works in multiple orphanages in Latvia by providing materials and their own labor to improve the living conditions of the kids (e.g. reconstruction of the balcony, painting, garden works, etc.) • A long-term cooperation with the Finnish Red Cross has been initiated in order to generate more systematic and long-term social engagement. The goal is to engage both employees and stakeholders in volunteer work to help the underprivileged people and communities. We chose Red Cross as our partner because it is a well-known, impartial and independent worldwide organisation. The Finnish Red Cross offers companies Pg. 05 Human Rights several possibilities to channel their efforts in volunteer work and charity. • Donations has been made to different organisations such as the Red Cross and to the Disaster Assistance due to the typhoon in the Philippines.

The Group's complex operations with many employees and a number of relationships to customers in the private and public sectors, suppliers, the press and the securities market, requires a great deal of honesty and integrity from those who act on behalf of Atea. It is expected that all Group employees safeguard and promote the reputation of the Group by acting in accordance with the ethical guidelines and responsibly in relation to colleagues, business associates and society at large. The aim of the ethical guidelines for the Atea Group is to ensure that persons who act on behalf of the Group perform their activities in an ethically responsible manner, and in accordance with the standards and guidelines that may apply at any given time, hereunder guidelines for environment, human rights, labour rights and anti-corruption. The ethical guidelines are implemented in all Atea’s operating countries and it is the responsibility of each country’s Managing Director to ensure that all employees are familiar with the guidelines. In 2013, therefore, the company has launched an effort to revise and clarify its own guidelines for ethical trade, and implement, among other things, a declaration that will be part of agreements with different suppliers. Furthermore, procedures are established under which senior Atea employees must sign a declaration stating that they understand the code of ethics and perform their work in accordance with this code. This will ensure that Atea’s, and not least the international requirements in relation to the environment, human rights, labour and anticorruption, are complied with by both the company itself and its suppliers..
