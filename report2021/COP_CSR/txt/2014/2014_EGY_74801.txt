CSR VISION Corporate social responsibility of BAG is the philosophy of the Company’s long-term and sustainable development, which enables to harmoniously integrate successful business with basic human values and national development priorities. Socially responsible approach to conducting business envisages the following: Page 6 1. High quality satisfaction of our consumers’ needs; 2. Strict compliance with legislation; 3. Ensuring labour safety and investing in human potential development; 4. Taking into consideration the expectations and opinions of the stakeholders, systematic approach to building up trustworthy and mutually beneficial relations with them based on ethics requirements; 5. Contribution to development of local communities, in particular through mutually beneficial social partnerships Objectives of BAG CSR policy:  Leadership based on our confirmed readiness to build up systematic contribution to tackling public problems in practice and for the long term;  Harmonious development of dialogue and cooperation in relations between BAG and the key stakeholders;  Distinct contribution of our socially oriented BAG programs and projects to long-term business sustainability;  Further perfection of corporate governance practices. We are striving for achieving a confirmed status and established reputation of successful and reliable company. Such a status will become a ponderable competitive advantage of BAG in today’s complex economic and socio-political conditions. Social responsibility of BAG means the successfulness and ethics of business, since this provides people with work and deserving labour conditions and allows them to be confident in their future. In CSR BAG is governed not only by charity motives, but also by sober calculations: business success and sustainability directly depend on social and economic prosperity of the area where we help. 9. BAG AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS Sustainable development of business is possible only in socially favorable environment. From its part, the society quite understandably demands from business to adhere to human values (environmental protection, legitimate forms of ownership, positive economic and social impact of enterprises, etc.), and not to sidetrack difficult issues. The stakeholders the society groups, with which a business Page 7 organization interacts either directly or indirectly form those demands and demonstrate increasing activity in setting up channels of communicating and cooperating with business. In order to conduct successful and efficient CSR policy, it is fundamentally essential for us to determine the stakeholders and influence groups of priority importance for BAG, clarify their expectations and suggest efficient forms of interaction within the range from dialogue to possible joint actions and programmers. In particular, the key stakeholders are the following target groups, which share common interests with us: Shareholders and investors are directly interested in long-term and sustainable growth of BAG’s value, in its proven ability to manage and mitigate risks, as well as in openness and ethic principles and practice of corporate governance. Customers are interested in the quality of products, improvement of legal mechanisms for protection of their own rights, growth of investment and better customer management before and after sales. Employees expect full compliance with legislative regulations in respect to labour relations, and provisions of individual and collective labour agreements; management’s respect for individual rights and human dignity; daily concern of BAG for minimizing health and environmental harmful impacts of operations; dedicated assistance to the development of their qualification and direct influence of the business success upon labour remuneration and amount/nature of social package. Business partners are interested in the widest possible application of the principles of transparency, impartiality and fairness, adherence to moral standards supported by legal acts and corporate ethics codes. \ 10.AREAS AND DIRECTION OF BAG CSR POLICY When setting up the framework and lines of its social responsibility, BAG is guided by global compact principles which are implemented in BAG’s activities in such areas as corporate governance, business ethics, health and safety, labour relations, charity, etc. 10.1 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Page 8 In 2010, we initiated a review of our global human rights strategy. Following this, we articulated our approach in a document, “Our Approach to Human Rights” which explicitly communicates how our business activities promote human rights. This reflects both our heritage and our conviction that respect for human rights is crucial to business success. Our Approach to Human Rights reinforces the key areas where our business activities impact on human rights and how we address this through our Corporate Responsibility. Our commitments, our policy BAG respects Human rights and acts in favor of diversity, equal opportunities and contributes to fight against all forms of discrimination and this is through ensuring that all its staff members have understood UNs basic principles and are willing to implement sustainable solutions throughout the organization. Approach and implementation The following initiatives and program were conducted as a part of our human rights strategy: ‐ Employment Equity BAG is an equal opportunity employer and employs personnel without regard to their race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, language, citizenship, creed, religion, gender, age, marital status, physical and/or mental handicap or financial ability. While remaining alert and sensitive to the issue of fair and equitable treatment for all, BAG has a special concern with the participation and advancement of members of four designated groups that have traditionally been disadvantaged in employment: women, visible minorities, aboriginal peoples and persons with disabilities. ‐ Harassment BAG is Keen to provide a harassment-free environment for its employees. Mutual respect, along with cooperation and understanding, must be the basis of interaction between members and staff. BAG will neither tolerate nor condone behavior that is likely to undermine the dignity or self-esteem of an individual, or create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. There are several forms of harassment, but all can be defined as any unwelcome action by any person, whether verbal or physical, on a single or repeated basis, which humiliates insults or degrades. “Unwelcome”, for the purposes of this policy, refers to any action, which the harasser knows or ought to reasonably know as not desired by the victim of the harassment. Specifically, racial harassment is defined as any unwelcomed comments, racist statements, slurs, jokes, graffiti, literature, pictures or posters, which may intentionally or unintentionally offend another person. Page 9 Sexual harassment is any unwanted attention of a sexual nature such as remarks about appearance or personal life, offensive written or visual actions like graffiti, degrading pictures or physical contact of any kind. ‐ Workplace Violence Workplace violence can be defined as a threat or an act of aggression resulting in physical or psychological damage, pain or injury to a worker, which arises during the course of work. Further to the definition of violence, is the definition of abuse. Abuse can be verbal, psychological or sexual in nature. Verbal abuse is the use of unwelcomed, embarrassing, offensive, threatening or degrading comments. Psychological abuse is an act which provokes fear or diminishes a person’s dignity or self-esteem. Finally, sexual abuse is any unwelcomed verbal or physical advance or any sexually explicit statement. BAG has a zero tolerance limit with regards to harassment and violence. Employees engaging in either harassing or violent activities will be subject to discipline, which may include termination of employment, removal from boards or committees and possibly criminal charges Education Reform Programs Bavarian Technical School BAG will open its new technical school by September 2014. The technical school will be three academic years from grade 10 to grade 12. The school will be specialized in the automotive technical studies including electrical & electronics, mechanical and body studies. The school will cover also the studies for automotive manufacturing. We plan to start with only 25 students and to increase the number with the market needs. Vocational Education Reform Program with the higher ministry of education  A mutual cooperation Protocol agreement on October 2009 was signed between BAG and the Matarya Higher Technical institute valid for 5 years.  The institute introduced new Car technology section in the 3rd and 4th years starting from 2010/2011 semester.  BAG still provides suggestion to the study materials, supervise the labs and working stations provided by the institute to provide training and experience transfer from their side on the agreed Celebes.  BAG still provides training courses for the Engineers and Technicians responsible for this education reform program, and provide visits for the students to its working premises and factory. Page 10 10.2 Labour Rights Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: The business should support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; Principle 5: The business should support the effective abolition of child labor Principle 6: The business should support the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Employees are the main asset and key stakeholders in BAG. BAG does not use forced labour and we work with suppliers and business partners to ensure they do not use forced labour either. We respect people’s rights to have employee representation. We also conduct the employee climate survey annually to provide insight on employee commitment, engagement, inclusiveness and overall perception of the employment experience. BAG offers a comfortable working environment for all employees supported by labour policy respected by all BAG members. The objective of the labour policy as follow: 1. Attraction, motivation and retaining of talented professionals with a lot of initiative; 2. Continuous extension of knowledge and skills to address the current and prospective business tasks of BAG; 3. Development of managerial potential and provision of highly professional and stable management of the Company; 4. Creation of favorable labour conditions ensuring social insurance and health care for all the employees and their families. 5. Teamwork and good working environment with standard health and safety operations in place. 6. Good Income so the Employee would feel safe and loyal to the company. 7. Good relationships with local authorities make doing business easier. 8. Providing a fully understanding the wider impact of the business can to help the employees develop new products and services. 7.2.2 Labour principles  Compliance with the existing labour legislation and respect for and observance of human rights; Page 11  Ensuring a decent and competitive reward for the personal contribution of the employees with regard to their professionalism, job complexity and responsibility;  Investment in the education and training of the employees to help them achieve their full potential and make their substantial contribution to the business success of BAG;  Providing social support to the employees, the size and forms of which will depend on the efficiency of BAG business.

Similar disciplinary action will be taken against any supervisor or manager who directly approves (and/or condones) such a breach or has knowledge of the breach and does not take appropriate remedial action. Reporting Breaches of the Code: BAG Employees must report immediately any circumstances, which may involve deviation from this Code to their Manager, Deputy GM, GMs, or Chairman .The internal auditors of BAG are Page 15 responsible for reviewing the operations. This review will be reported to the chairman with any breaches of this Code. 8.4 Compliance with the Code – ASE Group Representatives: 10.3 Environment Rights Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Our commitments, our policy BAG is committed to the manufacturing, sales, and after sales of passenger cars and ensuring that those products meet and exceed customer needs and expectations; in addition to meeting BAG standards concerning Safety, Quality, Environment, Reliability and Durability; offering our products at competitive prices. Approach and implementation: We can only achieve our objectives with our qualified people through well-orchestrated teamwork, continual improvement, prevention of pollution, providing a safe working environment as well as compliance with legal and other requirements driven by integrity and innovation. Commitment to this policy is demonstrated by the implementation of Quality, Environmental and Safety Management System, which satisfies the requirements of ISO/TS 16949:2002, ISO 14001:2004, and OHSAS18001:2007 as minimum requirements. BAG is vitally interested in the health and safety of its employees. Protection of employees from potential hazards or occupational diseases is a major continuing objective. BAG will exert every effort to provide a safe and healthy work environment. Abuse of Drug and Alcohol Policy: BAG Management has the right that at any time and without prior notice to make Drug test through a medical check to any of the employees on all levels. Positive results or refusal of this test will lead to immediate dismissal from work. Non – Smoking: All BAG premises are non-smoking areas. Environmental Inspection Page 16 Page 17 Reducing energy consumption Initiative: Page 18 Waste Water Treatment Initiative Page 19 Health and Safty Certificate: H&S OHSAS 18001/2007 Page 20 10.4 Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Our commitments, our policy In BAG we believes that corruption in the private sector takes many forms, among them bribery, undue influence, fraud, money laundering and collusion. Corruption distorts markets and has a negative impact on society as a whole, in both the developing and the developed world. Private sector corruption contributes to environmental damage, health and safety problems, economic instability and human rights violations by diverting scarce resources, both financial and human. Private sector corruption erodes confidence in public institutions and deprives citizens of capital needed for economic growth, therefore in our battle against corruption we knew that it is a daring, risky, long drawn-out process and yet we chose to fight against corruption in all its forms. Approach and implementation Unacceptable Payments Bribes, kickbacks, inducements or similar payments must not be made to or for the benefit of any government official, customer, supplier or any other party in connection with obtaining orders or favourable treatment such as gaining improper advantage in BAG business or operation; or to induce a government official to do something illegal or improper on behalf of or for the benefit of BAG; or for any other purpose. This prohibition extends not only to direct payments but also to indirect payments made in any form through distributors, representatives, consultants, agents or other third parties. Giving or Receiving Gifts Circumstances where receiving gift is prohibited: BAG Employees are prohibited to give, receive, seek or accept any gifts, loans, services, hospitality, entertainment or any other type of gifts from government officials, customers, supplier, or any other party in connection with BAG operations. In addition BAG employees are not to make any personal favours which go beyond the common courtesies associated with accepted ethical Ground Service Provider and general commercial practice. Page 21 For avoidance of doubt, any gift received by BAG Employee (or series of gifts from one party) which might, as a matter of judgment, must be reported to the chairman with full details of the background of the gift. On behalf of BAG, I am pleased to submit our Communication on Progress reflecting our continued commitment to the UN Global Compact and its 10 Principles.
