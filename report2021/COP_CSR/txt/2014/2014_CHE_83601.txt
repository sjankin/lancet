In July, I was pleased to reconfirm our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). This is in recognition of the importance of the UNGC principles – human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. We continue to embrace the use of frameworks such as UNGC and the Global Reporting Initiative to help provide a transparent and consistent approach to implementing CSR into our business. We see this emerging more as a trend in industry, and we fully support it. We were also pleased last year to gain our first ISO14001 certification for our Rome office. The certification of our environmental management approach has been a key part of our strategy, and Rome is just the first step in our certification roadmap.
