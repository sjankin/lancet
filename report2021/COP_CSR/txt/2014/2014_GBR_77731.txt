Anita Dominiguez from our El Paso, Texas office won the Xtreme Sustainability award. She coordinated initiatives by our El Paso office to reduce energy costs, purchase eco-friendly supplies, eliminate paper waste and implement a recycling programme, which garnered them a first-place win in the City’s Green Business Challenge. After winning first place, Anita worked with the City of El Paso to create a video highlighting AMEC’s efforts and offer advice to other companies looking to implement a sustainability programme.
