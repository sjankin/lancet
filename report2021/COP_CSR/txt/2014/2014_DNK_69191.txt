We continue to support the Global Compact, as a governing principle in our sustainability efforts. This sustainability report functions as our Communication on Progress report to the UN on how our sustainability efforts have progressed. In 2013, our efforts resulted in a new sustainability strategy for the Danfoss Group that combines existing and new sustainability initiatives. During its implementation period from 2014 to 2017, the strategy will guide the work on sustainability at Danfoss within a strengthened group-wide framework, while at the same time setting out clear goals for the work in our organization in the areas of energy savings, occupational health and safety, ethics and product lifecycles. We look forward to regularly reporting on the results of our sustainability efforts. In 2013, we continued ethical conduct training for all people managers, and more than one thousand managers and other key employees completed our anti-corruption program during the year. We are currently developing compliance programs in competition law, export controls and data privacy, and our managers and key employees will be asked to complete these mandatory programs on an ongoing basis. In 2013, Danfoss acquired the remaining shares in Sauer-Danfoss, which now forms part of the Danfoss Group under the name of Danfoss Power Solutions. The activities and achievements of Danfoss Power Solutions in the area of sustainability form part of this report. Niels B.

Energy-efficient business Energy consumption and CO2 emissions In 2013, Danfoss emitted approximately 251,000 tonnes of CO2 as a result of its electricity and heat consumption. The sources were both direct emissions (its own plants for the generation of power and heat) and indirect emissions (purchase of power and heat from external sources). Emissions for 2013 are significantly higher than for 2012, because they also include all Danfoss Power Solutions factories, which were not included in previous sustainability reports. In 2013, Danfoss Climate & Energy emitted 129,600 tonnes of CO2 , against 126,500 tonnes of CO2 in 2012. The increase was attributable to the inclusion of data from Danfoss Turbocor in the United States combined with increased activity at the factories in China, whereas emissions from the other factories in the segment declined. Danfoss’ electricity consumption accounted for 84% of the Group’s total CO2 emissions in 2013, corresponding to 212,000 tonnes. Heating contributed 39,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Danfoss’ total energy consumption grew by 76% to 2,296 TJ due to the fact that data from Danfoss Power Solutions is now included. The consumption of electricity represented 67% of Danfoss’ total energy consumption in 2013. Of the total electricity consumption, 14% came from renewable sources such as solar, water, wind and biomass, against 18% in 2012. Electricity from nuclear power plants accounted for 13% of the Group’s consumption, and the rest derived from fossil sources such as coal, oil and gas. Sustainability report 2013 I Danfoss Group 11  WORK AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN CORE AREAS Consumption of energy for heating grew by power to cover the annual consumption of 37% relative to 2012 due to the inclusion of 400 single-family homes. The plant, which data from Danfoss Power Solutions in the will have a payback time of eight years, has report.

In 2013, many employees also applied for help in connection with church confirmation of their children, stays at boarding schools and Christmas. The foundation also provided financial support for vacations to the benefit of many families with children. The foundation granted total financial support of approximately DKK 2.9m in 2013.
