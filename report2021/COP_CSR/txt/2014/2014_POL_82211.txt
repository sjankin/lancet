We live in Management Board a world of constant change, and now we live longer, more active and more conscious lives than ever before. The astonishingly dynamic development of medicine and pharmacy creates opportunities and possibilities that we could hardly dream of until very recently. Those developed countries which have reached a certain level of civilisational maturity are able to manage these advances wisely and in a socially-responsible manner to enable universal access to modern healthcare and thus improve the general quality of life. Combining sincere passion with a rational financial approach, we at the Pelion Healthcare Group have driven these changes with our ideas and actions for twenty-three years. Today, I am proud to say that the Pelion Healthcare Group enjoys a strong position on the Polish and Lithuanian healthcare markets, strengthening it steadily through the trust placed in us by millions of customers who visit our pharmacies and thousands of pharmacists and pharmaceutical manufacturers with whom we collaborate. Furthermore, I would like to stress that in the years ahead the Pelion Healthcare Group intends to pursue its strategy with pride, responsibility and perseverance, consistently building its competitive advantage on the healthcare market.

As far as I know, Urtica is the only wholesaler supplying products to hospitals only. Due to the specific nature of their operation, hospitals are a very difficult client: a drug, which is often extremely hard to find and expensive, must be delivered within a few hours to a place hundreds kilometres away from the warehouse. However, this is never a problem for Urtica. It is all about the people at Urtica, both the company's management and, perhaps even more importantly, the representatives who contact the pharmacy directly; it is all about their reliable, professional, and patient-oriented approach to work. Cooperation with a wholesaler like Urtica goes beyond a mere performance of the contract. It gives us satisfaction and pride, because we are helping those in need, our patients, whose life is often at risk. With its strong logistics base, Urtica is always able to deliver drugs quickly to any place in Poland, even within 6 hours from order placement. 41-42 BUISNESS LINES RETAIL Retail More than 16 million 11 thousand more than items dispatched every year dispatches every year Corporation of European Pharmaceutical Distributors N.V.
