These and other market developments will call for new solutions from Kamstrup, and we will do our best to deliver. After all, one of our two main values is customer orientation. Knowing-Understanding-Saving To save energy and water you need to understand how you are consuming it, Per Asmussen, CEO and that in turn is only possible if you have appropriate meters installed. This is the essence of Kamstrup’s smart energy and water meters. Data from the meters keeps our customers informed about how much energy and water they consume over different periods and across different appliances. For instance, information from all p.p.

Energy consumption (headquarters) The graph below shows a generally steady drop in energy consumption per unit of production since 1998. 2009 and 2010 saw small increases in energy use per unit because production fell during the recession; as a result, the fixed component of our energy consumption increased as a proportion of the total. Our building stock increased by 3000 m2 in December 2012, and during 2013 we welcomed 80 new colleagues; both of these changes are reflected in the increased amount spent on electricity and heat last year. Unusually cold weather at the beginning of 2013 also resulted in extra heating costs.
