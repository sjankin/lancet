The establishment, equipping and expansion of the environmental department is a sure indication that the company is obliged and motivated to ensure that all activities of the mine conform to the commitments made in the EMP throughout the life of mine (LOM). This commitment forms an integral part of GMC’s Environmental Management System (EMS) and is subject to annual budget and management accounting systems of the operations. The company will continue to allocate adequate resources available every year to ensure implementation of reclamation of decommissioned waste dumps and mined-out areas and at the same time ensure the smooth running of its mining operation. The Community Assistance policy will be reviewed annually to assess the impact on recipient communities and with the view to improving their standard of living. In addition, management of GMC will ensure that its operations do not endanger the environment but rather maintain its obligations in respect of sustaining the environment.
