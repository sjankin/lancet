The only requisite was to fill in a form in order to make sure that all the proposed NGOs followed basic and general requirements. The name of this project was “Contigo, 1=2” ( With You, 1=2). A total of nine proposals were submitted to the Sustainability Committee which selected the three that best represented the goals of CSR Strategic Plan: Fundación Manolo Maestre Dávila, NGO Ongawa and Fundación Xaley.

HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES III.2 Implementation of human rights actions  Collaboration for training of disabled people: CAMPVS Fundación Carmen Pardo-Valcarce realized that integration of people with disabilities required for the disabled community to work to find solutions to break down existing barriers. Thus, FCPV has launched an innovative educational project following trends imported from the U.S. and UK to involve private enterprise in the world of higher education. People with disabilities may not feel as if they are ready for the job because they do not have the practical, hands-on experience required for skilled positions or they do not have all abilities required. Many people with disabilities who are entering the workforce have not had the benefit of summer employment or part-time jobs as well as specialized training. As a result of this situation, companies cannot find in these people the adequate training for some positions. CAMPVS is just the answer to this issues. Keeping in mind that hiring and supporting people with disabilities must be a successful endeavor for the business, an innovative training system was designed. Three different and very specific training paths have been defined to give students just the right practical experience needed for a job posting. Along the way, companies will play a key role since employees of the different sponsor companies will teach subjects related this “careers”. Globalvia is already one of the Sponsors and has appointed two employees as mentors. Training sessions (CAMPVS) 20 20 III.
