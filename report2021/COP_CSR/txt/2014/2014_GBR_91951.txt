United Nations Global Compact Communication of progress April 2013 March 2014 Introduction We first expressed our support for the Global Compact in June 2004. I became the Chief Executive of Severn Trent in April 2014, and am delighted to renew our support for the 10 principles embodied in the Global Compact. The Compact challenges us to uphold principles relating to human rights, labour relations, anticorruption and the environment. At Severn Trent we have a strong culture of doing just this, a culture which starts with our Code of Conduct – ‘Doing the right thing the Severn Trent way’ – and which reflects the Global Compact principles in the standards of behaviour we expect from our colleagues and the way we run our business.
