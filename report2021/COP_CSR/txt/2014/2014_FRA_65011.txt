How do you intend to communicate your progress to the shareholders? “Shareholders are constantly involved in the HENNER’s operations by taking on a management role. They are perfectly informed and a part of the Global Compact program, and the measures brought in.” I GLOBAL COMPACT 2013 THE CHAIRMAN’S COMMITMENT FOR HENNER EDITORIAL Since 2003, HENNER has been committed to supporting the ten principles of Global Compact in the areas of human rights, working conditions and environmental protection. We are convinced that the overall benefits of a plan such as Global Compact lie in the results achieved at every level of the company, which is why all Group employees continue their efforts to increase the positive effects of our action and behaviour, and explore all possible areas of improvement. In 2014, personally and on behalf of HENNER, the company I chair, I maintain my commitment to the cause of Global Compact, and ask all HENNER’s employees to further their efforts:  To preserve the benefits of action already taken,  To find new constructive and practical ideas that can be put into place. In 2014, we will continue to work in support of the decisions made as part of our ten-year strategic plan for 2020. This strategy reinforces our desire to keep people at the heart of our actions. By reiterating our commitment to this Charter, our Group and its 1,300 employees are resolutely committed to supporting the ten principles of Global impact through their everyday action, by applying the internal charter, and by adhering to these Values. It is on behalf of the Group as a whole that I am taking on this commitment without reserve. Charles Robinet-Duffo Chairman and CEO of HENNER 3 II HUMAN RIGHTS AND WORKING CONDITIONS OPERATIONS LED IN 2013  Facilitating access to care to every Member covered by HENNER-GMC As a reminder, HENNER-GMC has been particularly focused on network expansion in developing countries since early 2004, owing to the growing number of Members residing in these countries. Since 2009, a number of local and regional agreements were signed, considerably increasing the size of the network. The HENNER-GMC medical network has grown 50% since 2012, and now has some 24,500 healthcare providers in 153 countries outside the United States. In the United States, HENNER-GMC has signed deals with several partners (Global Excel in 2013, Olympus Managed Health Care, United Healthcare International), providing access to local networks including some 4,700 hospitals and 724,000 providers of outpatient care, and no fewer than 67,000 dentists across the country. Our members benefit from the following services  Direct settlement for hospitalisation and out-patient care  Exceptional rates keeping healthcare expenses and member copayment down. The teams of network coordinators were reinforced in 2013 with the recruitment of eight correspondents based in Africa, helping us to get closer to our customers, improve access to healthcare, and facilitate the reimbursement process. HENNER is now located in seven countries: Lebanon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ethiopia, Yemen and South Africa. In 2014 we will also have correspondents set up in Afghanistan and Côte d’Ivoire. In 2013, were opened the Carte Blanche network for optical treatment to our international members, giving them access to beneficial healthcare rates. A medical team of 7 doctors (5 in 2012), 2 dental surgeons (1 in 2012), a pharmacist, a negotiator and 6 medical assistants (4 in 2012) are constantly monitoring various measures to ensure our members receive quality treatment in line with international medical standards, particularly with regards to hospitalisation. Their worldwide healthcare expertise, backed by a database of reasonable and customary rates charged in 153 countries, guarantees that the quotes they offer are consistent and avoids the risk of abuse.  Fighting HIV/AIDS and supporting the persons living with AIDS The specific action plan managed in the HIV/AIDS field includes:  The search for healthcare providers offering specialised treatment More than 350 specialised providers around the world  Deals involving medical cooperation and the direct settlement of healthcare expenses More than 200 deals signed in 25 countries  A pilot program to promote HIV/AIDS testing in six countries (Burundi, Niger, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) 4  Within the medical department, a team deals specifically with monitoring patients with AIDS, in association with their regular doctors. This action is supported by a highly trained French expert, to assist the advising doctors at HENNER-GMC  The publication of a charter in which HENNER-GMC is committed to its clients and employees in favour of a prevention policy and fight against HIV/AIDS. In 2013, HENNER-GMC established a partnership with Sida (Aids) Info Service to provide our members in need with expertise and advice in Africa.  Supporting and promoting the fight against malaria In some countries where malaria is endemic, HENNER-GMC has launched a communication campaign among members to reiterate the best medical practices for treating malaria recognised by the World Health Organisation. We also run a communication campaign directly among the providers of the HENNERGMC network to review the treatment plans depending on the severity and ensure that reasonable rates are being charged for that treatment in order to ensure ease of access.  Promoting local management As part of the group's development, since the beginning of 2007, HENNER-GMC has continued recruiting local employees in Curitiba (Brazil), Singapore, Tunis, and Nairobi (Kenya) and since 2013, Lisbon (Portugal). Local recruitment offers the following advantages  For employees: Working for a company that respects human and workers’ rights. All employees at our regional branches abroad are recruited locally, trained in Paris at the company’s head offices, and supervised by the central teams. They all benefit from healthcare cover provided by the company which goes beyond the legal obligations of the country of residence. This is done to maintain equality among all HENNER-GMC staff.  For the company: Enabling us to providing our members with local, quality service, adapted to the country in which they live. In 2013  Staff numbers at our regional branches abroad increased by 32.7% (up 17.4% in 2012, 14.7% in 2011, and 2.5% in 2010). In France, HENNER-GMC continues to recruit staff regardless of their country of origin or culture. In 2013  Staff numbers in France rose by 14.2% (9.2% in 2012, 7.4% in 2011, and 2.7% in 2010). 5  Wage policy The HENNER-GMC wage policy shows that wages increase faster than the official indices despite the harsh economic climate.

Work groups representing the various entities and positions held within the company contributed to our projects. To do so, the Board of Directors asked several employees to take an active role in the project as representatives, both nationally and internationally (owing to cultural differences) right from the early phases. 6 Work groups were formed to deal with the following topics:  HR practices in France  HR practices abroad  Business practices 1  Everyday behaviour in France, 1  Everyday behaviour broad  Philanthropy 1 The expression, “daily behaviour” refers the consequences of resource management (energy, water, paper, ink) and of the environment of our daily activity. In all, 46 suggestions for improvement were made by the groups. Action is now being taken and monitored by the steering committee. Various resources have been used to promote a healthy environment and to reduce energy consumption: see §III). In 2011, 63% of improvement actions suggested by our work groups were set up (i.e. a total of 29 actions). In 2012, 41.2% of the remaining actions was taken (7 actions). In 2013, of the 10 remaining improvement actions, two of those actions suggested by our work groups were set up (i.e. an achievement rate of 20%). 7 III ENVIRONMENT ENERGY CONSUMPTION The power consumption policy and adapted resources have proven effective over the past few years. Results achieved in 2013 (see Effective change and effective power consumption in France).

The recycling of IT equipment is done by an authorised company, certified by Moody Certification. In 2008, the following results were achieved:  3,608 kg of monitors  7,212 kg of towers, printers and other equipment. In 2009, the following results were achieved:  1,397 kg of monitors  583kg of towers, printers and other equipment. In 2010, the following results were achieved:  590kg of monitors  1060kg of towers, printers and other equipment. In 2011, the following results were achieved:  780kg of monitors  1332kg of towers, printers and other equipment. In 2012, there was no recycling of IT hardware as the entire range had been replaced (end of the recycling cycle). In 2013, the following results were achieved:  808 kg of monitors  6315 kg of towers, printers and other equipment. PAPER RECYCLING AND INK CARTRIDGES Used paper recycling was stepped up in 2013 (packaging, archives) as was ink cartridge recycling (printers, photocopiers). The efforts made in recycling have had encouraging results. There was a clear reduction in the use of toner cartridges, owing to the implementation of the all-in-one printer/photocopiers, allowing us to significantly reduce the number of pages printed (see the paragraph on paper consumption). 9 Results obtained in 2013 Percentage change since 2007 160,0% 143,0% 140,0% 124,2% 120,0% Recycled paper 100,0% (tone) 88,9% 94,5% 97,0% 80,0% Toner (number of 63,6% cartridges) 60,0% 62,3% 46,3% 40,0% 24,2% 18,2% 30,1% 20,0% 3,0% 0,0% Année Année Année Année Année Année Année 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 WATER CONSUMPTION The water consumption policy along with simple and adapted resources have proven effective over the past few years.

In 2013, HENNER-GMC recruited a fraud manager based in Paris, with fraud coordinators in each team in Nairobi, Tunis, Curitiba, Boca Raton and Singapore. The coordinators have been trained in the detection of fraud and how to begin investigating. The teams in Paris and the local coordinators were responsible for:  All client service officers have been trained to detect suspicious cases (counterfeit invoices, verification of treatment provided);  Training for officers to share experience in detecting an increasing number of cases  Medical analysis of cases by the medical department to detect medical inconsistencies This analysis is based on expertise of HENNER-GMC doctors in medical practices around the world,  The setting up of two steering committees (international and French domestic) to decide on cases of fraud  Itemised procedures detailing the client service officer’s role and responsibilities, the internal audit department and the involvement of the medical department  Reporting to clients and risk carriers when further disciplinary or judiciary action is needed. Changes in the cases analysed: In 2011, 11 cases of suspected fraud were detected in France and 254 abroad In 2012, 13 cases of suspected fraud were detected in France and 268 abroad In 2013, based on organisation and training, we detected 10 cases of suspected fraud in France and 492 cases abroad. There was a considerable increase in suspected fraud abroad, which rose 83.6% from 2012. 12 Henner, a simplified joint-stock insurance broker and administrator With €8,212,500 capital listed on the Paris company register under B 323 377 739 – VAT No. 48323377739 ORIAS No. 07.002.039 (see www.orias.fr).
