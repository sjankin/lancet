These phenomena transportation sector for the first time in the construction industry, and is in the middle of developing eco-friendly railway may cause to lessen discharge efficiency and increase Operating and Maintenance cost. To solve this problem, POSCO E&C infrastructure engineering technology. As embedded rail tracks are constructed mainly in urbanized areas, this system developed two types of discharge system, which are standard flat type and high elevation type according to apply to local requires stricter standards for noise and vibration as well as high insulation technology. To this end, we developed the terrain. The standard flat type features sluice gate and drainage pipe at the bottom those easily control the water level system that fixes rail on cast-in-place slabs with synthetic resins. The materials for the upper track can be varied and flexibly inside and protect bubbles to leak out to the sea. The high elevation type that intend to used for coping with elevation used depending on the purpose. This system can also be applied to busy roads that need reduction in noise, vibration and making bubble problem worse can simplify the discharge system by decreasing high energy head.
