Essential quality The whole undertaking is more than the sum of its parts. The quality of the details is pivotal to the standard of the finished result. An attention to detail is therefore evident in each product and each encounter with the brand. The ­almost proverbial Wilkhahn quality has made the brand successful internationally and a prime example of design made in Germany. In order to guarantee constant utility value, particular emphasis is placed on durability when selecting 6 Product responsibility. Our antidote to the throw-away society is to provide products where form, function and materials have a purpose and are long lasting. Our product-responsibility concept therefore follows well-defined guiding principles: 1. “The longer the better” – is the maxim of the products 3. “Reuse and recycle” – in this case, the goal is to we develop. We achieve this thanks to: ­continue to use the whole product or parts of it and ­recycle • meaningful and useful innovations that make life easier it at the end: and more pleasant in the long term; • because the products are modular, expendable parts • first-rate materials, surfaces and technical solutions that can be exchanged and features added or retrofitted guarantee quality even after many years; (e.g. armrest types, covers, cushions, surfaces); • distinctive, timeless and appealing designs with the • connecting points in the product can be dismantled for ­potential to become classics. easy repair; • if possible, we use materials made of one component 2. “Less is more” – is not just a design principle to us, that are marked as such, making them ideal for recycling. it means: • we cut down on the materials used in order to make 4.

Wilkhahn primarily uses European cowhide which is treated in a multi-phase process from the rawhide to the blue skin to the top-quality finished product. The types of leather made for Wilkhahn are produced in selected tanneries in Germany and in countries bordering the ­European Union. Through regular audits of its leather suppliers, Wilkhahn also monitors compliance with stringent European environmental standards to ensure that the tanning agents and other substances used to produce leather don’t harm the environment. The leathers chosen by Wilkhahn are first class, robust and have pleasant haptics. Above all, due to suitable tanning agents and dyes, they don‘t have a strong smell and are Wilkhahn fabric groups which contain information on their non-toxic. When creating the Wilkhahn collection, in addioptical, haptic and technical characteristics in detail. tion to the aesthetic appeal, special emphasis was placed on including no harmful substances.

At the same time, none of on the environment. Wilkhahn’s finishes harms human beings and the environment. All Wilkhahn metal finishes comply with the EN 71-3 European standard. Originally developed as a standard for babie’s toys, it stipulates very stringent thresholds for chrome VI and other heavy metals. When powder coating, the metal components are covered with a robust varnish. The coating systems applied by Wilkhahn consist of epoxy resins which are sprayed in a dry process onto the cleaned and electrostatic metal sur­ faces as a fine powder. The metal parts are then heated for a few minutes to approx. 180°C until a permanent coating with an even gloss is produced. At Wilkhahn, the powdercoating process is especially eco-friendly because surplus powder is recovered and energy consumption is cut due to short heating phases. The powder varnishes also contain no organic solvents or heavy metals. During chrome-plating, in a galvanic refinement process very thin layers of precious metals are applied that protect the metal underneath from corrosion. Chrome-plated surfaces are timelessly elegant and extremely tough. Wilkhahn uses carefully selected partners to carry out the chromeplating process. Regular inspections of the galvanising processes also ensure that strict environmental-protection and health-and-safety regulations are also kept to during chrome plating. 10 Ecological environmental product information Our goal is to be transparent and open with our customers, tails on material composition and recycling proportions) also so we publish eco-relevant information on the most imporinclude information on the product’s life cycle.

Tests on dimensions and mechanical loads are carried out in our own lab in accordance with the relevant international standards. As part of the product development process, each product is tested according to pre-determined criteria. This also includes testing ecologically beneficial materials. In order to make no compromises on usage quality and product safety, the same testing specifications apply to all materials. For example, product parts made of materials with a high recycling content must pass the same endurance tests – otherwise there is no ecological gain. Inspections of incoming goods in compliance with the AQL standard (Acceptable Quality Level) and inspections during manufacturing (in accordance with documented assembly and inspection instructions) ensure production quality remains constant. Before a product is delivered to the customer, it has to pass a final inspection. In the case of conference table systems, layout plans, detailed drawings and surfaces are checked again and any accompanying multimedia equipment is tested. Even with Wilkhahn swivel chairs, visual and functional checks on the finished product are an integral part of the quality programme. External tests Independent controls guarantee objectivity and make us perform better. Therefore, Wilkhahn regularly adds external testing procedures to its own internal system. These inspections include product tests on whole tables and chairs and chemical and physical material tests. For example, we are interested in the level of shine on our varnishes, or whether our glues retain their adhesiveness. Microscopic analyses of metal structures, for example where particularly safety-critical metallic compounds are concerned, are part of the range of tests carried out by external experts. Greenguard™ Good indoor air quality is important to Wilkhahn. We verify that our ­products fulfil top demands by carrying out regular Greenguard™compliant product testing. The test results are published in a data base in the public domain: www.greenguard.org 11 Back in 1996, the German Environmental Foundation presented Wilkhahn with an award for its impressive concept.

Sustainability in the Wilkhahn supply chain Wilkhahn’s principle of fairness doesn’t just end at its own factory gates. We encourage exemplary production conditions at our suppliers’ sites as well. Wilkhahn consequently signed a framework agreement in 2009 with the international unions which primarily fosters good working conditions and employee rights based on the principles of the International Labour Organization (ILO) of the United Nations. In signing the agreement Wilkhahn undertakes to carry out recurrent controls of its supply chain and to assess the corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the environmental performance of its suppliers and partners. By deploying a transparent tendering procedure and a six-monthly integrated assessment of suppliers, Wilkhahn uses all the ­options possible to ensure the high standards required of health and safety and environmental protection are maintained and improved consistently. Pneumatic lifting equipment at Wilkhahn helps our employees to move table tops. This systematic support when lifting and carrying objects prevents back complaints. 24 Training at Wilkhahn.

Low levels of emissions (welding gases) and noise occur when cutting, drilling, grinding and welding metals.

The ­recovered energy corresponds to the heating value of about 20,000 litres of heating oil. As a result, Wilkhahn can ­prevent the emission of about 60 tonnes of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide per year. Powder coating At the Bad Münder headquarters, Wilkhahn has eco-friendly powder-coating machinery. Various metal components such as table frames, tubes and star bases are coated with different colours to suit customer preferences and at the same time protected from corrosion. Before the powder is applied, preparation is carried out ­beforehand. To start with, Wilkhahn employees inspect the metal parts to ensure they are in a perfect condition before they are transported to a water basin by a shuttle. After ­degreasing and rinsing in the water basin, industrial drying follows and the powder is then fired at 190°C. The process water and energy consumption required here are key environ­mental aspects. Over the last few years, Wilkhahn has invested in enhanced insulation of the facility and it ­optimised heating circuits.

The particles of varnish in the area are suctioned and filtered off to render them safe for employees and the environment. Wilkhahn creates the superb quality of the varnished sur­ faces in several phases. Between multiple coats, special grinding procedures in a separate grinding room ensure the varnish is equally glossy all over. During grinding, efficient suctioning ensures excellent results and that working practices are safe. Similarly to the actual varnishing process, the waste air, polluted with particles of dust, is cleaned via a dry filter. Coarse residues from the grinding process are collected in cassettes at the sides and are disposed of as a harmless substance. As a result, no aqueous waste is ­generated in the varnishing process. Computer-controlled mixing and cleaning procedures cut the waste during varnishing to a minimum. Compared with the manual application of varnishes in the past, varnish ­consumption is reduced substantially. No unused varnish needs to be disposed of because only the quantities actually required are provided fully automatically. Each part is checked to ensure the surface and other quality features are perfect before the powder varnish is applied. 28 The powder varnishes used by Wilkhahn are practically free of solvents and heavy metals and come in colours to suit customer preferences.

We assess our suppliers regularly and carry out on-site audits, we indicate potential for improvement and increase mutual trust with our selected partners. Logistics – sales and dispatch Customers in over 90 countries appreciate Wilkhahn office furniture. The office swivel chairs, conference and standalone tables leave the production facilities in Bad Münder, Castellón and Sydney by different modes of transport and head for their destinations. In the process, Wilkhahn only uses as much packaging as required for safe delivery to the customer.

Customised cardboard packaging helps transport high-quality Wilkhahn products safely and is kind to the environment. 30 Milestones Energy efficiency and climate protection Since 2011 two solar-thermal systems have been heating the water required for sanitation purposes at the Wilkhahn headquarters in Bad Münder. Consequently, from spring to autumn fossil fuels are no longer required for generating hot water. The electric circulation pumps otherwise needed are switched off during those months. By using solar heat, about 3,000 litres of heating oil are saved per year. So ­solar-thermal power makes a vital contribution towards energy efficiency and to protecting the climate. The Wilkhahn headquarters have been receiving district heating from a biogas plant since August 2011. To do so Wilkhahn laid an underground heating pipe several ­kilo­metres long and integrated a multi-boiler control system into the Wilkhahn power system. The district heating ­obtained from biogas is primarily used for heating the ­buildings, but also delivers process heat for table-top ­manufacture. Material efficiency Cardboard packaging is made from renewable feedstock.

In For many years, Wilkhahn has used relatively few solvents, 2013, Wilkhahn invested in an even more energy-efficient resulting in correspondingly low emissions. table-top press. This is not heated up electrically, but connected to the hot-water system for heating the building. This aspect was particularly important to Wilkhahn in order to avoid energy losses due to the conversion of electricity into heat. And Wilkhahn makes a special contribution to ­climate protection because the hot water for heating the press is previously heated from climate-neutral district ­heating from biogas. Efficient and sophisticated varnishing: by automatically mixing the varnish, applying underfloor suction and additional heat recovery, Wilkhahn makes ­topquality conference and standalone tables that comply with high health-andsafety and environmental standards. This is possible on the one hand due to eco-friendly varnishing processes that use materials efficiently. On the other hand Wilkhahn systematically avoids applying adhesives when upholstering furniture. In so far as ­technically possible, Wilkhahn office furniture is made ­without any harmful substances and by applying ­mechanical connecting elements. And there’s a metric for measuring the success of this Wilkhahn philosophy. When varnishing Wilkhahn tables, fewer than five tonnes of organic solvents annually have been emitted for years. At under 3.5 tonnes annually, the solvent emissions caused by adhesives are at an even lower level. ­Despite an increase in the number of Wilkhahn chairs made in Bad Münder, all statutory emission thresholds have been easily complied with (as specified by regulation Eco-friendly table manufacture at Wilkhahn: During pressing, the water which no. 31 of the German Act on ­Emissions). has been heated previously in a climate-neutral manner, ensures energy-efficient and lasting bonding of adhesives.

Over the last few years, electricity consumption was also cut. Electricity is primarily required for lighting the office and manufacturing buildings which we have been optimising for years. When using IT hardware such as telephones, computers and screens, Wilkhahn makes sure it uses ­energy-efficient models where possible. Consequently, in 2013 23 per cent less electricity was consumed at the Wilkhahn headquarters in Bad Münder than in 2007.
