OTHER CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION STRATEGIES The development and optimisation of powertrains are not the only offers ultra low rolling resistance (ULRR) tyres that will further reduce pathways to improving the environmental performance of vehicles. Vehicle carbon emissions. base, improved aerodynamics, reduced rolling resistance, reduced vehicle weight, use of renewable resources and research work are all factors that contribute to lowering the CO2 emissions of Peugeot and Citroën vehicles. VEHICLE MASS In addition to optimised powertrains and lower rolling resistance, lighter OPTIMISED MODULAR PLATFORM (EMP2) vehicles also reduce the amount of engine power needed to deliver equivalent dynamic performance, providing another opportunity to reduce Rolled out in 2013, the new EMP2 modular platform contributes a high CO2 emissions. A 100 kg reduction in vehicle weight, for example, yields a level of added value in terms of CO2. gain of around 10 g/km. Several mechanisms contribute significantly to the over 22% CO2 reduction: In 2007, PSA Peugeot Citroën launched an ambitious programme to reduce vehicle weights: 300 kg in 25 years. The objective is to introduce vehicles > significantly lighter-weight vehicles: 70 kg for sedans to 80 kg for MPVs; in 2013 that move down in inertia class in relation to the models being > redesigned aerodynamics; replaced, for a gain of more than 100 kg, while continuing to meet other > innovative technologies such as STT (Stop & Start), SCR (Selective project goals.

As of 2013, the new Peugeot 308 and the new C4 Picasso produced on The new Peugeot 208, 308 and Citröen C4 Picasso vehicles illustrate the EMP2 platform reach record power consumption levels: just 82 g of these significant gains. CO2/km for the first and 98 g of CO2/km (with the 1.6 HDi) for the second. Vehicle weights will be progressively be reduced between now and 2020 without compromising the customer experience by using high performance steel materials (high-grade steel, aluminium alloys, composite materials, AERODYNAMICS AND ROLLING RESISTANCE plastics and natural fibres) and by optimising design thanks to digital simulation. The more aerodynamic the vehicle, the less fuel it uses and therefore the less carbon it emits because less engine power is needed to move it. To continue to reduce the aerodynamic resistance of its vehicles and limit SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE: GREEN their CO2 emissions, PSA Peugeot Citroën has set the following objectives: MATERIALS AND BIOFUELS > optimise vehicle dimensions; > improve the aerodynamics of vehicle underbodies; As a responsible automobile manufacturer, PSA Peugeot Citroën takes into account the gradual depletion of fossil fuels and the environmental impacts > integrate aerodynamic solutions such as spoilers and deflectors while of its vehicles throughout their life cycle. This is why green materials (i.e. developing attractive styles. recycled or made from natural, renewable materials) are used whenever Because rolling resistance also comes from tyres, PSA Peugeot Citroën possible to build Peugeot and Citroën vehicles, which are all capable of has launched a joint programme with Michelin to optimise the tyres on its running on alternative fuels. vehicles.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2013 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Without qualifying our opinion, given the context of the Group’s economic and financial environment as described in the Group’s management report, we draw your attention to the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: > Note 2.4 on significant estimates and assumptions which specifies the accounts for which estimates and assumptions used are particularly sensitive; > Note 9.1 on the impairment test on the assets of the automotive segment which leads to the recognition of an impairment for an amount of €1,009 million. This note indicates that the tests have been performed based on a medium-term plan for which the funding arrangements had not been finalized as at 31 December 2013. It further indicates that the Group is confident in its ability to implement the corresponding funding; > Note 40 on subsequent events. It indicates, in particular, that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board decided, on 18 February 2014, to submit a capital increase of €3 billion to the next Shareholders’ Meeting. It specifies that this capital increase is aimed at financing among others the current medium-term plan of the Group and revitalizing its development; > Note 36 which sets out the Group’s and Banque PSA Finance’s liquidity position; > Note 3 which sets out the impact of the first application of IAS 19 (revised) concerning employee benefits. 280 PSA PEUGEOT CITROËN 2013 Registration Document 20 FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANY’S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROFIT AND LOSSES 20.3. > Consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2013 II. JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: > the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires your company to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuation of certain assets, liabilities, income and expenses, the most significant of which are outlined in Note 2.4 to the consolidated financial statements “Accounting principles – Use of Estimates and Assumptions.” For all of these matters, we examined the appropriateness of the accounting rules and methods used and the information given in the notes to the financial statements. In addition, we examined the consistency of the assumptions used, their translation into figures, and the available documentation, and on that basis we assessed the reasonableness of the estimates made; > note 2.15 to the consolidated financial statements “Accounting Principles – Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” describes the accounting methods and assumptions used for impairment tests. According to Note 9.1 – “Impairment Loss on Automotive Division CGUs and Provisions for Automotive Division Onerous Contracts”, impairment tests led to the recognition of an impairment on the Latin American and Russian plants for €1,009 million. We verified that the impairment tests were carried out correctly, we verified the reasonableness of the underlying estimates and assumptions, we reviewed the calculations which led to the recognition of the impairment and we verified that the notes mentioned above provide relevant information. We also examined the funding arrangements for the medium-term plan contemplated by management and described in Note 40 – “Subsequent events”; > as indicated in Note 2.19 – “Accounting Principles – Deferred Taxes”, deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for in the statement of financial position as set forth in Note 12 – “Income tax”. This note indicates amongst other things that, in the absence of any prospect of recovery within the medium-term plan period, tax-loss carry forwards relating to the French tax consolidation generated over the year have not been recognized. We examined the Group’s tax forecasts, deferred tax assets and liabilities timelines and the consistency of overall assumptions used for this depreciation; > within the context of our assessment of the continuity of the Company as a going concern, we made an in-depth review of the liquidity position of the Group and of Banque PSA Finance detailed in Note 31 – “Current And Non-Current Financial Liabilities – Manufacturing And Sales Companies”, Note 32 – “Financing Liabilities – Finance Companies” and Note 36.1 A – “Management of Financial Risks – Financial Risk Management Policy – Liquidity Risk”. We notably reviewed the cash flow forecasts, the debt schedules, the covenants applicable to them, and the provisions relating to the State guarantee for the refinancing of Banque PSA Finance. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III. SPECIFIC VERIFICATION As required by law we have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

The recoverable amount OR LOSS of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The impairment test usually consists of estimating the asset’s value (a) Manufacturing and sales companies in use. Value in use is measured as the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Assets with indefinite useful lives, i.e. mainly goodwill, These assets are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.

The Statutory Auditors’ Report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the Management Report and in the documents addressed to the shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.

These financial statements have been approved by the Managing Board. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. I. OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2013 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. II. JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: At each balance sheet date, your company determines the value in use of its “Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates” and “Other investments” according to the methods described in notes 1C and 1D to the financial statements, and sets aside a provision for impairment when the carrying amount exceeds the value in use, as specified in notes 5 and 7 to the financial statement. As part of our assessment of the accounting principles applied and of significant estimates made to prepare the financial statements, we verified the appropriateness of the accounting methods described in the notes to the financial statement and correct application thereof, as well as of the reasonableness of the underlying estimates. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. 388 PSA PEUGEOT CITROËN 2013 Registration Document 20 FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANY’S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROFITS AND LOSSES 20.4. > Peugeot S.A. financial statements at 31 December 2013 III.

On 6 March 2014, Jonathan Goodman, Executive Vice-President, Corporate Communications of the PSA Peugeot Citroën Group appointed Grant Thornton as independent third-party expert. Grant Thornton submitted its expert report to the Company’s Managing Board on 10 March 2014. The conclusions of this report are presented below. > INDEPENDENT VERIFIER’S REPORT ON THE REVIEW OF SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL INFORMATION PUBLISHED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT This is a free translation into English of the verifier’s review report issued in the French language and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. The review report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and standards applicable in France. Financial year ending 31 December 2013 To the Shareholders, In our capacity as professional accountants identified as independent verifier, for which the accreditation is recognised by the COFRAC, we hereby report to you on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information published in the Management Report prepared for the year ended 31 December 2013 (hereinafter the “CSR information”), pursuant to Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code du Commerce). Management’s responsibility The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the Management Report including the CSR information in accordance with the requirements of Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code presented as required by the company’s internal reporting guidelines (the “reporting guidelines”) and available on request at the company’s headquarters. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory requirements and by the Code of Ethics of our profession inserted in the 30 March 2012 decree specific to the activity of accountants. Furthermore, we have implemented a quality control system to ensure compliance with the Code of Ethics, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations. Independent veriﬁer’s responsibility It is our role, on the basis of our work: > to attest whether the required CSR information is presented in the Management Report or, if not presented, whether an appropriate explanation is given in accordance with the third paragraph of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation of disclosure); > to express limited assurance on the fact that, taken as a whole, the CSR information is presented fairly, in all material aspects, in accordance with the reporting guidelines (Assurance report). Our work was conducted by a team of 7 people during the period of November 2013 to February 2014 for duration of approximately 12 weeks. We called upon the help of our CSR experts to complete this assignment. 1. ATTESTATION OF DISCLOSURE We conducted our work in accordance with the professional guidelines and the legal order published on 13 May 2013 determining the methodology according to which the independent verifier conducts his mission: > we met with the various managers and got acquainted with the direction the Company is taking in terms of sustainability, with regards to the social and environmental consequences of the company’s business and its societal commitments and, where appropriate, the actions and programs that stem from it; > we compared the CSR information presented in the Management Report with the list set forth in Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code; > in the event of omission of certain consolidated information, we have verified that explanations are provided in accordance with the third paragraph of Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code; > we verified that the CSR information covered consolidated scope, i.e. the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of Article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code and the companies that it controls within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, subject to the limit set forth in the methodology note presented in paragraph 5.3 and 17 of the management report. Based on our work, we attest that the required Information is presented in the management report. 472 PSA PEUGEOT CITROËN 2013 Registration Document 23 INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTIES, APPRAISERS’ STATEMENTS AND STATEMENTS OF INTEREST Independent verifier’s report on the review of social, environmental and societal information published in the Management Report 2. ASSURANCE REPORT We conducted our work in accordance with the professional guidelines and the legal order published on 13 May 2013 determining the methodology according to which the independent verifier conducts his mission and in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagement ISAE 3000. We met approximately 10 times with the managers responsible for the preparation of the CSR information within the department in charge of the process of collection of the information and where appropriate we also met with those in charge of internal control and risk management procedures in order to: > assess the appropriateness of the reporting standards with respect to its relevance, completeness, neutrality, clarity and reliability by taking into consideration, where applicable, the industry’s best practices; > verifify that the Company had set up a process for the collection, compilation, processing and control to ensure the completeness and consistency of the CSR information. We also familiarise ourselves with the internal control and risk management procedures relating to the compilation of the CSR information. We determined the scope of the tests according to the nature and importance of the CSR information taking into consideration the characteristics of the company, its actions in respect to the social and environmental consequences of its activities, its direction as far as sustainability is concerned. We also determined tests according to the industry’s best practices. Concerning the qualitative consolidated information that we have considered the most significant (1): > for the consolidating entity and the sites, we reviewed the related documentary sources and conducted interviews to check the qualitative information (organisation, strategies, actions). We set up analytical procedures and verified the quantitative information using sampling techniques in order to check the consistency of the calculations and the consolidated information in order to reconcile the data with the information in the management report; > we selected sites (2) based on their activity, their contribution to consolidated indicators, their location and risk analysis. We have conducted interviews to verify the proper application of procedures and set up tests using sampling techniques to verify the calculations performed and reconcile data with supporting evidence. The selected sample represents 19.7% of the workforce and between 26 and 49% of the quantitative environmental information tested. As far as the other CSR information is concerned we have assessed its consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company. Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations given in the event of total or partial absence of information. We believe that the sampling techniques and the sample sizes that we set up by exercising our professional judgment have allowed us to formulate a limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required a more extensive review. Because of the use of sampling techniques, and because of other limits inherent to the functioning of any information system and internal control system, the risk of missing out a significant anomaly in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated.. Conclusion Based on our work we did not identify any significant misstatement likely to call into question the fact that the CSR information, as a whole, has been presented fairly, in accordance with the reporting standards.
