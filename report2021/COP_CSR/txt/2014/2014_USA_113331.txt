ELI LILLY AND COMPANY U.N. GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS November 22, 2014 To Our Stakeholders, Eli Lilly and Company is pleased to submit our Communication on Progress (COP) report for 2014. We’re proud to voice our continued support for the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and its 10 principles related to human rights, labor, the environment, and combating corruption. Our commitment to the Global Compact reflects the core values of integrity, excellence, and respect for people, which have guided our company since its founding more than 130 years ago. Every year since Lilly joined the UNGC in 2010, we have reported on our commitments to the UNGC principles, and our related activities and progress toward goals that we have set for ourselves. Since our initial submission in 2010, we have integrated our UNGC COP content into our annual corporate responsibility report. This enabled us to cover the UNGC principles alongside a range of other topics of interest to global stakeholders across all areas of our business. This year, we have decided to adjust the timing of our annual corporate responsibility report, moving our publication date from November to May. This decision was based on a range of factors, including the desire to provide more timely updates on our corporate responsibility efforts, achievements, and challenges, as well as to align disclosures on Lilly’s corporate responsibility goals and performance with our annual shareholders’ meeting and the release of Lilly’s annual report. We feel this new timing, issuing earlier in the calendar year, will help us to be more responsive and transparent to those interested in Lilly and our work. Indeed, it reflects a deepening and a strengthening of our commitment to communicating about our corporate responsibility in a more timely and coordinated way. Our next corporate responsibility report will be issued in May 2015. While we transition to our new reporting schedule, we are issuing our UNGC COP this year in a streamlined format. In the pages that follow, you will find highlights of our corporate responsibility efforts from the past year, an updated table of key performance indicators, with historical data through 2013, and links to relevant programs and issue areas, as mapped to the UNGC principles. When Colonel Eli Lilly founded our company in 1876, he set a clear precedent for serving communities and operating responsibly. We have never forgotten that how we operate our business today has an impact on tomorrow. We strive to continually improve, to learn and to share with all of you what we’re doing to contribute positively to society, and to build on our brand promise—to unite caring with discovery to make life better for people around the world. Sincerely, John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D. Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer 1 01 LILLY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY HIGHLIGHTS: 2013–2014 IMPROVING GLOBAL HEALTH Our public-private partnerships, like the Lilly NCD Partnership The complexity of global health challenges requires and the Lilly MDR-TB Partnership, help to expand access to collaboration across the private sector, governments, medicines in low-income populations worldwide.

Damage means the actual or imminent alteration of the environment so as to render the environment harmful, detrimental, or injurious. 8  uring routine inspections in 2006 and 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identified potential weaknesses in our leak detection and repair program at our Lilly Technology Center D facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition, in 2006 we voluntarily reported to the state and city environmental agencies that we had exceeded an annual limit for air emissions. In response to these events, we have implemented numerous corrective actions and enhancements to our environmental programs. We paid a penalty of $337,500 in early 2011 to settle the case. There was no harm done to employees, neighbors, or the environment as a result of these events. 6 04 SUPPORT FOR THE U.N.
