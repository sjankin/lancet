The rollout plan was operational model. With the help of the mobility organisation, successfully tested from the end of 2012 until early 2013. After around 500 people found a new future outside PostNL in 2013 . approval from the works council in March 2013, we started The mobility organisation has helped more than 7,500 former implementation in all regions. employees since 2006. In 2013, we employed over 23,000 parttimers in our mail delivery operations. Part-timers represent 93% PostNL closed 115 distribution locations step by step (from 260 of our delivery staff, equivalent to over 7,300 FTE in delivery staff. to 145 depots for mail preparation) and restructured 63 distribution locations in 2013, while maintaining quality well above the required level. Across the Netherlands, 24 larger scale distribution locations became operational, all in existing PostNL locations. Business clients were pro-actively informed and consumers were informed when delivery times changed. The restructuring is ahead of schedule and we realised strong cost savings on accommodation and facilities, transportation costs from the sorting centres to the depots, on a lower number of front line management and the migration towards a part-time organisation. In July, we announced further changes to our Dutch operational model. We will abolish the area structure and manage our processes and our staff centrally. As a consequence, the number of staff jobs in the new operational model will be reduced by almost half. We are able to achieve such a strong reduction by concentrating and combining activities, as well as discontinuing certain activities. The capacity required to implement the new operational model will be phased out in the coming years. Additionally, within marketing and sales and head office, significant steps were and will continue to be taken to reduce support staff, this year and in the coming years. Despite all the changes in operations we were able to improve our quality level to 95.9%, well above the required level of 95% (and above the 2012 level of 93.9%) and reduced the number of complaints. The complaints can be traced to individual mail deliverers and a tight control system has been set up. In case of lost and found items, mail is delivered personally to the customer by the manager of the mail deliverer. Preparations have been made to cancel collection on Sunday and delivery on Monday (funeral cards and urgent medical letters excluded). Discontinuing Monday delivery in 2014 will contribute to our savings in 2014. Together with Parcels, we are conducting tests in the car unit to further optimise and integrate parts of the collection and delivery of mail and parcels. The final design and first implementation steps are expected in 2014. For the longer term, tests have been carried out with new sorting machines to replace the current sorting machines for large letters and to further improve our preparation processes. To compensate for the higher volume decline, additional cost savings of €75 million were identified from existing and new plans. The additional cost savings are not expected to impact the earlier communicated bandwith of 2,700 to 3,500 redundancies.

Mail in the Netherlands experienced an increased decline in addressed mail volumes in 2013. This was primarily the result of continued substitution by electronic media as well as cost-saving programmes initiated by some of our key customers. Additionally, loss of volumes to competition, the economic crisis and price elasticity had a negative impact on volumes. In total, the underlying volume decline in addressed mail was 11.6%. The volume of unaddressed mail items decreased by 5.9% due to substitution and loss to competition. Besides volume development, prices are a key factor in PostNL’s financial performance. During 2013, prices for single mail items and bulk mail were increased well above inflation. Operating revenue for Mail in the Netherlands decreased by €109 million (-4.8%) compared to 2012. This revenue decrease is mainly due to volume decline in addressed mail items, partly compensated by a positive price/mix effect (€66 million), and a decrease in revenue from unaddressed, data and document management services and Bruna (€43 million). The restart of the organisational restructuring resulted in higher than anticipated cost savings while enhancing the delivery quality and level of productivity. In 2013, of the €95 million cost savings initiatives, €79 million were achieved within Mail in the Netherlands. 22 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Report of the Board of Management | Chapter 5 5 Parcels PostNL's Parcels segment operates parcels businesses and logistics services in the Netherlands and in Belgium.

That’s why, even in a year of significant restructuring and downsizing, we continued to put a lot of effort into the recruitment and retention of young talent and experienced professionals. In 2013, we hired 19 new trainees for our Young Executive Programme (YEP) and filled 63 vacancies with experienced professionals. We also continue to invest in our development programmes and in 2013 we introduced the new ‘Leading Into The Future’ (LIFT) programme for senior executives. The main objectives of this programme are to develop the strategic skills of these executives and to strengthen their entrepreneurship and the impact they have as senior leaders on their teams and associates. In 2013, we also continued other leadership development programmes such as Mastering Your Leadership Programme (MYLP) (17 attendants) and the international-oriented Nexus programme (9 attendants). MYLP is PostNL's company-wide programme to develop talented managers and high-potentials to become senior business leaders. Nexus is a cross-international programme for process and people managers to develop personal growth combined with an international mindset and business focus. Our employees receive feedback on their performance in the annual performance management cycle. In the 2013 talent review sessions, we evaluated almost 2,000 employees to identify future leaders and specialists and to discuss their next career steps and development needs. We believe that stimulating the development of our employees leads to more motivated people. To support a management style that is in line with the required cultural change programme, we introduced the following new leadership competencies: connecting, entrepreneurship, delivering, trust and solving. The company continues to invest in career websites and social media. Our internal vacancy pool had 180,000 visitors in 2013 and the number of PostNL followers on Linkedin doubled from 8,000 to 16,000. This way we are able to connect and build relationships with a great variety of multi-disciplined employees within the labour market. PostNL finished in the top 10 of 550 companies that participated in a digital recruitment contest. Next to these development programmes, we also want our workforce to be fit and healthy. Per location there are a variety of training modules, health and safety instructions and other tools including professional support and training on safe lifting, life style programmes for drivers and health and vitality events promoting awareness among employees to stay fit and healthy on the job.

The Board of Management confirms that it is responsible for PostNL’s risk management, internal control, integrity and compliance systems and has reviewed the design and the operational effectiveness of these systems for the year ended 31 December 2013. The outcome of this review and analysis has been shared with the audit committee and the Supervisory Board and has been discussed with PostNL’s external auditor. Based on the outcome of the PostNL-specific approach to risk management, internal control, integrity and compliance as outlined above, the Board of Management believes to the best of its knowledge that PostNL’s internal control over financial reporting worked effectively over the year ended 31 December 2013 and provides reasonable assurance that the financial reporting is free from material inaccuracies or misstatements. The above, however, does not imply that PostNL can provide certainty as to the realisation of strategic business and financial objectives. Nor can PostNL’s approach to internal control over financial reporting be expected to prevent or detect all misstatements, errors, fraud or violation of laws or regulations.

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PostNL N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries (hereafter referred to as ‘PostNL’, ‘Group’ or ‘the company’). Following the demerger of Express in 2011 and the sale of 15% of the shares of TNT Express in 2013, PostNL holds a share of 14.8% in TNT Express N.V. (‘TNT Express’). Both PostNL and TNT Express are listed on NYSE Euronext in Amsterdam. PostNL provides businesses and consumers in the Benelux, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy with an extensive range of services for their mail needs. PostNL’s services involve collecting, sorting, transporting and delivering letters and parcels for the company’s customers within specific timeframes. The company also provides services in the area of data and document management, direct marketing and fulfilment. The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by PostNL’s Board of Management and Supervisory Board on 24 February 2014 and are subject to adoption at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 16 April 2014. Classification of TNT Post UK as assets/liabilities held for sale In December 2013, PostNL reached an agreement with LDC to establish a joint venture that will allow TNT Post UK to roll out its end-to-end postal delivery service. The joint venture will provide the funding and expertise for the phased implementation of the end-to-end service, following successful trials in London and a recent extension to Manchester. Completion is expected in 2014 subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory clearances. At completion, PostNL will have a 40% stake in the joint venture. As a result, control will be lost. This resulted in the transfer of the assets and liabilities of TNT Post UK to 'held for sale' at the end of 2013. IFRS 5 'Assets held for sale' requires assets to be valued at the lower of their fair value less costs of disposal and their carrying value. The carrying value equals the net assets of TNT Post UK in the consolidated financial statements. Fair value less costs of disposal is based on the agreement reached with LDC. In 2013, an impairment of €12 million was recorded to align the carrying value to fair value less costs of disposal, taking into account expected rebranding costs of €6 million. Under the new accounting rules for joint ventures (IFRS 11), the financials of the UK activities will be equity accounted for after completion of the transaction. This will materially affect the reported revenue and operating income of PostNL. For details on these financials, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Reclassification and partial sale of the stake in TNT Express In January 2013, UPS withdrew its offer for TNT Express announced in March 2012. Accordingly, the stake in TNT Express no longer met the criteria under IFRS 5 to be classified as an asset held for sale and was therefore accounted for as investment in associates using the equity method. Following IAS 28, the reclassification can be applied retrospectively or in the current year. Management decided to apply the change in the reporting of the stake in TNT Express as investments in associates retrospectively as from the moment it was accounted for as assets held for sale. Consequently, the comparative figures of 2012 have been restated. Following the withdrawal of UPS' offer in January 2013, the share price of TNT Express declined from €8.43 on 31 December 2012 to €6.85 on 27 September 2013, resulting in an impairment charge of €263 million. On 6 December 2013, PostNL sold part of its stake in TNT Express at a price of €6.20 per share, resulting in gross cash proceeds of €507 million and a book loss of €106 million. The partial disposal consisted of a private placement to institutional investors of 81,743,614 TNT Express ordinary shares (15% of the outstanding share capital of TNT Express). The remaining stake comprises 80,386,421 TNT Express ordinary shares, equivalent to 14.8% of the outstanding share capital of TNT Express. In accordance with IAS 39, the 14.8% stake in TNT Express is considered an available-for-sale financial asset measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value recognised in other comprehensive income. The fair value as at 31 December 2013 amounts to €542 million and has been determined by multiplying the closing share price of €6.75 on 31 December 2013 by 80,386,421, the total number of issued ordinary shares held by PostNL. For all financial details, see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Reclassification of customer contact services In 2013, PostNL decided to stop the sales process of its customer contact services. Accordingly, the criteria under IFRS 5 to be classified as assets held for sale were no longer met and customer contact services will no longer be reported as assets held for sale. The results will continue to be reported in PostNL Other. 74 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Summary of significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless stated otherwise. All amounts included in the financial statements are presented in euros, unless stated otherwise. Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of PostNL have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and Dutch law. IFRS includes the application of International Financial Reporting Standards including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and related interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRICs). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying PostNL’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in ‘Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying PostNL’s accounting policies’. Going concern In 2013, the impact of the revised IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ and the reduction in value of the stake in TNT Express resulted in negative consolidated equity attributable to the equityholders of the parent of -€679 million as at 31 December 2013. Corporate equity as at 31 December 2013 remained positive at €1,925 million. In 2013, the company made its first steps towards recovery via a solid financial performance driven by cost savings and price increases, taking into account the impact of our stake in TNT Express and the interest expenses resulting from the bond buyback programme. The company successfully agreed on a new pension and funding arrangement, reducing future pension contributions and limiting the risk and size of future top up payments. Despite significant payments related to pensions and restructuring, cash generated from operations positively contributed €160 million to our cash flow balance. Measures aimed at further improving the company’s liquidity and solvency include additional cost savings to cover the volume declines within Mail in the Netherlands and further increases in sales prices. The company will continue to limit and control capital expenditures and refrain from major acquisitions. The company will also refrain from (cash) dividend distributions as long as it has a negative consolidated equity and a credit rating lower than BBB+/Baa1. In the light of measures already taken or planned, management is confident it will be able to sufficiently strengthen liquidity and shareholders’ equity and recover towards a positive equity balance. The negative consolidated equity does not impact the company’s operations, the timing of debt reductions, access to the available credit facility or the stock exchange listing. As at 31 December 2013, the balance of cash and cash equivalents amounted to €469 million and the company has an undrawn multi-currency revolving credit facility of €570 million. Its financing arrangements do not include financial covenants and the first bond repayments are not due until 2015. The company has an investment in TNT Express that can be monetised over time, and although the company remains vulnerable to interest rate changes in relation to its pension obligations, it can also benefit from an environment of increasing interest rates. Based on the cash flow-generating capability of the company, the current finance structure and the company’s ability to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, PostNL’s financial statements have been prepared assuming a going concern. Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued certain International Financial Reporting Standards or amendments to these, and the IFRS IC has issued certain interpretations. The impact of changes, when adopted by the EU, on PostNL’s consolidated financial statements, has been assessed. PostNL Annual Report 2013 75 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2013 and have been adopted by the Group: • Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Financial statement presentation’ regarding other comprehensive income. The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to Group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). The amendments do not address which items are presented in OCI. The Group has applied the amended standard as of 1 January 2013. • In 2011, the IASB issued the revised IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. The revised IAS 19 was endorsed by the European Union on 5 June 2012 and is effective from 1 January 2013. The impact of the revised IAS 19 on the 2013 consolidated financial position and consolidated income statement of PostNL has been significant. The main changes in IAS 19R are: the requirement to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately within other comprehensive income, with the cancellation of the amortisation of the unrecognised actuarial gains and losses as a consequence, and the interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are replaced by a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit liability/asset. In addition, PostNL decided: to report the net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset as ‘Interest and similar expenses/income’ below operating income, to better reflect the operating expenses related to PostNL’s pension plans. The Group has applied the changes as of 1 January 2013. The comparative figures of 2012 have been restated for these changes. As future actuarial results must also be recognised immediately and are heavily dependent on interest rate movements and actual investment returns, consolidated equity will show fluctuations when actual developments differ from expected developments. • IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRS standards. The requirements do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRS. The Group has applied the new standard as from 1 January 2013. There are no other IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations taking effect for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2013 that would be expected to have a material impact on the 2013 accounts of the Group. Summary of restatements The effect on the year-end 2011 consolidated balance sheet of the adoption of IAS19R is as follows: • the reported pension assets of €1,217 million decreased by €669 million to a pension asset of €548 million, • the reported provision for pension liabilities of €219 million increased by €255 million to €474 million, • the reported deferred tax liability of €341 million decreased by €231 million to €110 million, and • the reported total equity of €414 million decreased by €693 million to a restated equity of -€279 million. The following table summarises the effect on the year-end 2012 consolidated balance sheet and 2012 consolidated (comprehensive) income statement of the adoption of IAS19R and the reclassification of the stake in TNT Express. 76 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 31 December 2012 Adoption Stake in 2012 Reported IAS19R TNT Express Restated Goodwill 111 111 Other intangibles 57 57 Plant and equipment 140 140 Other property, plant and equipment 396 396 Investments in associates 6 1,367 1,373 Deferred tax assets 23 47 70 Other non-current financial fixed assets 4 4 Pension assets 1,487 (1,487) Total non-current assets 2,224 (1,440) 1,367 2,151 Trade accounts receivable 432 432 Prepayments and accrued income 116 116 Other current assets 454 454 Total current assets 1,002 1,002 Assets classified as held for sale 1,430 (1,367) 63 Total assets 4,656 (1,440) 0 3,216 Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent 1,069 (1,370) (301) Non-controlling interests 11 (2) 9 Total equity 1,080 (1,372) (292) Deferred tax liabilities 451 (410) 41 Provisions for pension liabilities 193 342 535 Other provisions 117 117 Other non-current liabilities 1,617 1,617 Total non-current liabilities 2,378 (68) 2,310 Trade accounts payable 233 233 Other provisions 91 91 Other current liabilities 240 240 Income tax payable 28 28 Accrued current liabilities 595 595 Total current liabilities 1,187 1,187 Liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale 11 11 Total liabilities and equity 4,656 (1,440) 0 3,216 (in € millions) Year ended at 31 December 2012 Adoption Stake in TNT 2012 Reported IAS19R Express Restated Total operating revenue 4,330 4,330 Other income 32 (1) 31 Salaries, pensions and social security contributions (1,293) (30) (1,323) Depreciation, amortisation and impairments (250) 135 (115) Other operating expenses (2,528) (2,528) Total operating expenses (4,071) (30) 135 (3,966) Operating income 291 (30) 134 395 Interest and similar income 6 27 33 Interest and similar expenses (110) (22) (132) Net financial expense (104) 5 (99) Results from investments in associates 1 (14) (13) Reversal of/(impairment of) investments in associates 570 (122) 448 Profit/(loss) before income taxes 758 (25) (2) 731 Income taxes (80) 6 (74) Profit for the year 678 (19) (2) 657 Earnings per (diluted) ordinary share (in € cents)1 153.9 149.1 Gains/(losses) on cash flow hedges, net of tax (1) (1) Currency translation adjustment, net of tax 1 1 Actuarial gains/(losses) pensions, net of tax (661) (661) Share other comprehensive income associates (5) 2 (3) Total other comprehensive income for the year (5) (661) 2 (664) Total comprehensive income for the year 673 (680) 0 (7) (in € millions) 1 Earnings per (diluted) ordinary share are based on an average of 439,973,297 outstanding (diluted) ordinary shares (2012 retrospectively restated for stock dividend). PostNL Annual Report 2013 77 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2013 and not adopted early by the Group A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2013. These have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements: • IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Group has yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2017. The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed. • IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The Group has assessed the full impact of IFRS 10 and expects no material impact from its adoption. The Group will adopt IFRS 10 in the accounting period beginning 1 January 2014. • IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ and the revisions in IAS 28 ‘Associates and joint ventures’ will take effect on 1 January 2014. IFRS 11 puts more focus on the rights and obligations of the arrangement than on its legal form. There are two types of joint arrangement: joint operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where a joint operator has rights to the assets and obligations relating to the arrangement and hence accounts for its interest in assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Joint ventures arise where the joint operator has rights to the net assets of the arrangement and hence equity accounts for its interest. Proportional consolidation of joint ventures will no longer be allowed. IAS 28 revised includes the requirements for associates and joint ventures that have to be equity-accounted following the adoption of IFRS 11. The Group will adopt IFRS 11 and IAS 28 revised in the accounting period beginning 1 January 2014. The impact on the 2013 consolidated financial statements has been assessed. The impact on PostNL's revenue in 2013 amounts to -€144 million and the impact on operating income of 2013 is -€4 million. The impact on PostNL's profit for the period of 2013 is nil. • IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off-balance sheet vehicles. The Group has assessed the full impact of IFRS 12 and expects no material impact from its adoption. The Group will adopt IFRS 12 in the accounting period beginning 1 January 2014. There are no other IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial figures of PostNL N.V. and its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. All significant intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. A complete list of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures included in PostNL’s consolidated financial statements is filed for public review at the Chamber of Commerce in The Hague. This list has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of article 379 (1) and article 414 of book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity controlled directly or indirectly by PostNL N.V. Control is defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether PostNL controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to PostNL and are de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases. 78 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements PostNL uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The consideration of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. The consideration transferred also includes the fair value arising from contingent consideration arrangements. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of PostNL’s share of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of PostNL’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled to profit or loss. The non-controlling interest is initially measured at the proportion of the non-controlling interest in the recognised net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the noncontrolling interest in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against PostNL’s interests, except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses. Associates An associate is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture and over whose commercial and financial policy decisions PostNL has the power to exert significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity. PostNL’s share in the results of associates is included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method. The carrying value of PostNL’s share in associates includes goodwill on acquisition and includes changes to reflect PostNL’s share in net earnings of the respective companies, reduced by dividends received. When PostNL’s share of accumulated losses in an associate exceeds its interest in the associate, the book value of the investment is reduced to zero and PostNL does not recognise further losses unless PostNL is bound by guarantees or other undertakings in relation to the associate. Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby PostNL and one or more parties (together with PostNL ‘the ventures’) undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. A joint venture often involves the establishment of a legal entity. The ventures share the full economic ownership and are entitled to a share of the financial result of the activities of the joint venture rather than individual assets or obligations for expenses of the venture. Joint ventures in which PostNL participates with another party/other parties are consolidated proportionately. In applying the proportionate consolidation method, PostNL’s percentage share of the balance sheet and income statement items is included in PostNL’s consolidated financial statements. Functional currency and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is PostNL’s functional and presentation currency. Foreign currency transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using yearend exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and balances and from the translation at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement except for qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges that are directly recognised in other comprehensive income. PostNL Annual Report 2013 79 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Foreign operations The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: • assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates, • income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates, and • the resulting exchange rate differences based on the different ways of translating between the balance sheet and the income statement are recognised as a separate component of equity (translation reserve). Foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to the translation reserve. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recycled in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate. Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of PostNL’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired and is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint ventures is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates and is not separately recognised or tested for impairment. Gains and losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Separately-recognised goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to an annual impairment review. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets Costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical cost and amortised over the estimated useful life. Apart from software, other intangible assets mainly include customer lists, assets under development, licences and concessions. Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. An asset under construction is transferred to its respective intangible asset category at the moment it is ready for use and is amortised using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. Other intangible assets are valued at the lower of historical cost less amortisation and impairment. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is valued at historical cost using a component approach, less depreciation and impairment losses. In addition to costs of acquisition, the company also includes costs of bringing the asset into working condition, handling and installation costs and non-refundable purchase taxes. Under the component approach, each component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall be depreciated separately. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life, taking into account any residual value. The asset’s residual value and useful life is reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Land is not depreciated. System software is capitalised and amortised as a part of the tangible fixed asset for which it was acquired to operate, because the estimated useful life is inextricably linked with the estimated useful life of the associated asset. Leases of property, plant and equipment are classified as finance leases if the company substantially has all the risks and rewards of ownership. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in long-term debt. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. 80 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Impairment of goodwill, investments in associates, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset might be impaired. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels at which there are separately identifiable cash flows, being the cash-generating units where a cash-generating unit is not at a higher level than an operating segment. If the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the asset-specific risks. For the purpose of assessing impairment, corporate assets are allocated to specific cash-generating units before impairment testing. The allocation of the corporate assets is based on the contribution of those assets to the future cash flows of the cash-generating unit under review. For impairment testing of goodwill, the cash-generating unit is defined as the lowest level where goodwill is monitored for internal purposes. This level may be higher than the level used for testing other assets, but is not at a higher level than an operating segment. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period. Investment in associates PostNL will assess on each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that the investment in associates may need to be impaired. If the recoverable value of an associate is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the associate is reduced to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the asset-specific risks. The fair value less costs of disposal of an associate is reviewed based on observable publicly available market data. Possible impairment charges may be reversed if there is an indication that the impairment no longer exists or has been reduced. Finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any indication exists, the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. An asset is impaired if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. Financial assets and liabilities PostNL classifies financial assets and liabilities into the following categories: • financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, • loans and receivables, • held-to-maturity investments, • available-for-sale financial assets, and • financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial asset or liability was acquired. Management determines the classification of PostNL’s financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition. Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives and other assets and liabilities that are designated as such upon initial recognition. Measurement at fair value requires disclosure of how this measurement has been determined in relation to the following fair value measurement hierarchy: 1. quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets, 2. inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from quoted prices), and 3. inputs not based on observable market data. PostNL Annual Report 2013 81 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently re-measured at fair value on the balance sheet. PostNL designates certain derivatives as: • hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm commitment (fair value hedge), • hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge), or • hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge, changes in its fair value are considered to be effective and recorded in a separate component in equity until the hedged item is recorded in income. Any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is considered to be ineffective, or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness, is immediately recorded in the income statement. At the inception of the transaction, PostNL documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The company also documents the assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit and loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses that were reported in equity are immediately transferred to the income statement. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are directly recorded in the income statement. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and for which PostNL has no intention of trading. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities which PostNL has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories above. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months as from the balance sheet date. Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity. When available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as a gain or a loss. The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), PostNL establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s-length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuer’s specific circumstances. PostNL assesses on each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement – is 82 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses on equity instruments recognised in the income statement are not reversed through equity. Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the financial liability using the effective interest method. Inventory Inventories of raw materials and finished goods are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value. Historical cost is based on weighted average prices. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment of accounts receivable is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. Any reversal of the loss is included in the income statement on the same line as where the original expense was recorded. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are valued at fair value. Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand, bank account balances, bills of exchange and cheques (only those which can be cashed in the short term). All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts are not netted off from cash and cash equivalents. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. Assets held for sale are no longer amortised or depreciated from the date they are classified as such. Accounting for assets classified as held for sale requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates. In line with IFRS 5, management assessed compliance with these statements and the assumptions used in the fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs of disposal. Equity Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Where any Group company purchases PostNL’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, are included in equity. Provisions for pension liabilities The net defined benefit liability/asset for all pension and other post-employment plans that qualify as defined benefit plans is determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value of the plan assets. The resulting deficit or surplus is adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling and for any effect of minimum funding requirements. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Minimum funding requirements might affect the availability of reductions in future contributions or might give rise to a liability if the required contributions will not be available to PostNL once they have been paid. PostNL uses actuarial calculations (projected unit credit method) to measure the obligations and the costs. For the calculations, actuarial assumptions are made about financial variables (such as the discount rate) and demographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality). The discount rate is determined by reference to market rates using high-quality corporate bonds. Service costs are recognised as operating expenses in the income statement. Gains or losses on the amendment or curtailment of a defined benefit plan (past service costs) and gains or losses on settlement are all recognised as operating expenses in the income statement on the date of the amendment, curtailment or settlement. PostNL Annual Report 2013 83 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements The net interest expense/income on the net defined benefit liability/asset is recognised as ‘Interest and similar expenses/ income’ in the income statement (below operating income). Deviations between the expected and actual development of the pension obligation and plan assets, resulting in actuarial gains and losses, are immediately recognised within Other Comprehensive Income (net of tax). The impact of the asset ceiling and/or minimum funding requirements is also recognised within Other Comprehensive Income (net of tax). Pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or due. Other provisions Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, making it probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation on the balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The gross-up of the provision following the discounting of the provision is recorded in the income statement as interest expense. Provisions are recorded for employee benefit obligations, restructuring, onerous contracts and other obligations. The provision for employee benefit obligations includes long-service leave or sabbatical leave, jubilee or other long-service benefits, long-term disability benefits and, if they are not payable wholly within 12 months after the end of the period, profitsharing, bonuses and deferred compensation. The expected costs of these benefits are recognised over the period of employment. Actuarial gains and losses and the impact of changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to income in the period that such a gain or loss occurs. Related service costs are recognised immediately. The provision recorded for restructuring largely relates to termination benefits. Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. PostNL recognises termination benefits when the company has committed to terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or provides termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to their present value. Provisions for onerous contracts are recorded when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to arise from that contract, taking into account impairment of fixed assets first. The provision for other obligations mainly concerns provisions for legal and contractual obligations and received claims. Trade accounts payable Trade accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Income taxes The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The amount of income tax included in the income statement is determined in accordance with the rules established by the taxation authorities, based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities are calculated using the substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that they will be realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax group where a legally enforceable right to offset exists are presented net in the balance sheet. Revenue recognition PostNL's normal business operations consist of the provision of logistics services. Revenue are recognised when services are rendered, goods are delivered or work is completed. Revenue is the gross inflow of economic benefits during the current year that arise from ordinary activities and result in an increase in equity, other than increases relating to contributions from equity participants. 84 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Revenue of delivered goods and services are recognised when: • the company has transferred to a buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, • the company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control of the goods sold, • the amounts of revenue are measured reliably, • it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company, • the costs to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably, and • the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably. Contracted services that have not yet been rendered by PostNL on the balance sheet date, as well as outstanding customer prepayments for stamps and frankings, are designated as deferred income. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration of received amounts or receivable amounts. Amounts received in advance are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are rendered to customers or goods are delivered. Net sales Net sales represent revenue from the delivery of goods and services to third parties less discounts, credit notes and taxes levied on sales. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and return shipments. Other operating revenue Other operating revenues relate to the sale of goods and rendering of services not related to PostNL’s normal trading activities and mainly include rental income of temporarily leased-out property and custom clearance income. Other income Other income includes net gains or losses from the sale of property, plant and equipment and book results following the divestment of activities. Profit-sharing and bonus plans The company recognises a liability and an expense for cash-settled bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a calculation that takes into consideration the profit attributable to its shareholders after certain adjustments in accordance with contractual arrangements. Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based compensation plans As from 2013, PostNL operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for (conditional) shares of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense. Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of (conditional) shares that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. In addition, for some share-based compensation plans, employees provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement period and grant date. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Cash-settled share-based compensation plans PostNL operates a number of cash-settled share-based compensation plans. These involve a cash payment to employees for amounts that are based on the price of PostNL’s shares and which is equal to the gain that would have been made by exercising the notional options and immediately selling the shares in the market. The corresponding liability for the cashsettled plans is measured, initially and at each reporting date until settled, at the fair value of the rights, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted and the extent to which the employees have rendered service to date. Any changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of rights that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, PostNL revises its estimates of the number of rights that are expected to vest based on the non-market PostNL Annual Report 2013 85 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to liabilities. Interest income and expense Interest income and expense are recognised on a time-proportionate basis using the effective interest method. Interest income comprises interest income on borrowings, interest income on a net defined benefit asset, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, foreign currency gains and gains on hedged items. Interest expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest expense on a net defined benefit liability, unwinding of the discount on provisions, foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, except to the extent that they can be capitalised as cost of a qualifying asset. Government grants Government grants are recognised initially as income when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and PostNL has complied with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate PostNL for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same period in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate PostNL for the cost of an asset are deducted from the historical value of the asset and recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement as incurred during the period of the lease. Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to PostNL’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders. If PostNL offers its shareholders dividends or the choice of dividends in additional shares, the additionally issued shares are recognised at their nominal amount. Earnings per share PostNL presents (diluted) earnings per share (EPS) for its ordinary shares. EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, including the effects for dilution of ordinary shares following the obligations to employees under existing share plans. Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated at average exchange rates. Exchange rate differences affecting cash items are shown separately in the statement of cash flows. Receipts and payments with respect to taxation on profits are included in the cash flow from operating activities. Interest payments are included in cash flows from operating activities while interest receipts are included in cash flows from investing activities. Premiums paid on early repayments of long-term debt (relating to future interest payments) are included in cash flows from operating activities. The cost of acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and investments, insofar as it was paid for in cash, is included in cash flows from investing activities. Acquisitions of subsidiaries are presented net of cash balances acquired. Cash flows from derivatives are recognised in the statement of cash flows in the same category as those of the hedged item. Operating segment information PostNL reports three operating segments: Mail in the Netherlands, Parcels and International. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers. These chief operating decision-makers, who are responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the operating segments, have been identified as the Board of Management of PostNL that makes strategic decisions. 86 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying PostNL’s accounting policies The preparation of PostNL’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of PostNL’s financial statements. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. PostNL makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Employee benefits Post-employment benefits represent obligations that will be settled in the future and require assumptions to project benefit obligations. Post-employment benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period, based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. The accounting requires the company to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate, the rate of benefit increases and future mortality rates. Changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations, funding requirements and pension cost incurred. For details of the current funded status and a sensitivity analysis with respect to defined benefit plan assumptions, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Restructuring Restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring operations and/or relocations of operations, changes in PostNL’s strategy or managerial responses to declining demand, increasing costs or other market factors. Restructuring provisions reflect many estimates, including those pertaining to separation costs, reduction of excess facilities, contract settlements and tangible asset impairments. Actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates. In 2010, PostNL announced the restructuring of its operations in the Netherlands with the Master Plan III programme. The scope and measurement of the related restructuring provision depends highly on the projected cash outflows over the years, which are mainly driven by the estimated number of staff that will either be made redundant or apply for a mobility arrangement. In 2012, PostNL changed the rollout plan of the Master Plan III restructuring programme within the operations department. This is expected to result in substantially lower employee redundancies, which resulted in a partial release of the restructuring provision. In 2013, PostNL announced the further restructuring of staff and management within operations, the marketing & sales department and head office departments in the Netherlands, For details on the current Master Plan III restructuring provision, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Impairment of assets In determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill, tangible fixed assets and financial fixed assets, management must make significant judgements and estimates to determine whether the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the asset-specific risks. Determining cash flows requires the use of judgements and estimates that have been included in PostNL’s strategic plans and long-term forecasts. The data necessary for the execution of the impairment tests are based on management estimates of future cash flows, which make it necessary to estimate revenue growth rates and profit margins. Depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible fixed assets Tangible and intangible fixed assets, except for goodwill, are depreciated or amortised using a straight-line method based on the estimated useful life, taking into account any residual value. The asset’s residual value and useful life are based on PostNL’s best estimates and are reviewed, and adjusted if required, at each balance sheet date. Impairment of receivables The risk of uncollectability of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with, and the past due status of, doubtful debtors. Large accounts are assessed individually based on factors that include ability to pay, bankruptcy and payment history. In addition, debtors in certain countries are subject to a higher collectability risk, which is taken into account when assessing the overall risk of uncollectability. The assumptions and estimates used to determine the valuation allowance are reviewed periodically. PostNL Annual Report 2013 87 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Deferred revenue from stamps PostNL has to estimate the deferred revenues from stamps sold but not yet used by its customers. The company uses a seasonal model based on historical figures in order to account for the seasonal effects on sales from stamps (for example, stamp sales for Christmas greetings in November and December). Income taxes The company is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision and liability for income taxes. PostNL recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due, based on its best interpretation of the relevant tax laws and rules. In cases where the tax determination is uncertain, the company assesses the potential consequences based on its own internal analyses, supported by external advice, and either accrues the liability or discloses a contingent liability in its financial statements, depending on the strength of the company’s position and the resulting risk of loss. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such a determination is made. PostNL recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. This is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, and depending on the tax strategies that the company may be able to implement, changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required, which could affect PostNL’s financial position and net profit. Contingent liabilities Legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters, it is often difficult to predict the final outcome. The cases and claims against the company often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are subject to many uncertainties and complexities, including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim, the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law. In the normal course of business, PostNL consults with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters related to litigation. PostNL recognises a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event an adverse outcome is possible or an estimate is not determinable, the matter is disclosed. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale In December 2013, PostNL reached an agreement with LDC to establish a joint venture. At completion, PostNL will have a 40% stake in the joint venture. As a result, control will be lost. This resulted in the transfer of the assets and liabilities of TNT Post UK to held for sale at the end of 2013, in accordance with IFRS 5. In accordance with this standard, non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs of disposal. The fair value less costs of disposal is based on the agreement reached with LDC. The determination of this fair value less costs of disposal includes the use of management estimates and assumptions, which had an effect on the amount of impairment losses recognised. The separation of the financial performance of continuing and discontinuing activities also includes management’s best estimate and judgement. Considering that 40% of the TNT Post UK activities will be retained, management did not separate the financial performance of TNT Post UK from the continuing activities. Under the new accounting rules for joint ventures (IFRS 11), after completion of the transaction, the financials of the UK activities will be accounted for using the equity method. This will materially impact the reported revenue and operating income of PostNL. Key financial information of TNT Post UK is disclosed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 88 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position 1 Intangible assets Intangible assets: 143 million (2012: 168) Statement of changes Goodwill Software Other Total Amortisation percentage 10%35% 0%35% Historical cost 310 198 53 561 Accumulated amortisation and impairments (189) (168) (28) (385) Balance at 31 December 2011 121 30 25 176 Additions 1 12 17 30 Internal transfers/reclassifications 27 (27) Amortisation (25) (2) (27) Transfers to assets held for sale (11) (11) Total changes (10) 14 (12) (8) Historical cost 293 230 44 567 Accumulated amortisation and impairments (182) (186) (31) (399) Balance at 31 December 2012 111 44 13 168 Additions 12 15 27 Internal transfers/reclassifications 15 (15) Amortisation (27) (2) (29) Transfers to assets held for sale (16) (7) (23) Total changes (16) (7) (2) (25) Historical cost 284 204 36 524 Accumulated amortisation and impairments (189) (167) (25) (381) Balance at 31 December 2013 95 37 11 143 (in € millions) As at 31 December 2013, intangible assets consisted of goodwill totalling €95 million (2012: 111) and software and other intangible assets totalling €48 million (2012: 57). Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) and tested for impairment. The CGUs correspond to an operation in a particular country or region and the nature of the services provided. Compared to 2012, the CGU structure has not changed. The total goodwill balance at 31 December 2013 amounted to €95 million (2012: 111), of which PostNL has allocated €57 million (2012: 57) to CGU Mail in the Netherlands, €5 million (2012: 3) to CGU Parcels and €33 million (2012: 51) to International CGUs (€31 million to CGUs Germany and €2 million to CGU Italy). In 2013, goodwill totalling €18 million relating to TNT Post UK was transferred to assets held for sale and goodwill totalling €2 million relating to customer contact services was transferred back from assets held for sale. In 2012, goodwill of €11 million relating to customer contact services was transferred to assets held for sale and impaired for an amount of €9 million. In 2013, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded (2012: 0). In 2012, the additions to goodwill amounted to €1 million arising from the acquisition of Marvia B.V. within Mail in the Netherlands. Based on 2013 financial performance, a detailed review has been performed of the recoverable value of each CGU. The recoverable value is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal represents the best estimate of the amount PostNL would receive if it sold the CGU. The recoverable value is determined based on the value in use. The value in use has been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows. For both mature markets and non-mature markets, the estimated future net cash flows are based on a nine-year forecast and business plan, as management considers these forecasts reliable based on past experience. For markets considered non-mature, no steady state has been achieved to date. The applied growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the related operation and market. The cash flow projections based on financial budgets have been approved by management. PostNL Annual Report 2013 89 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position PostNL has determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rate used in the CGU valuations varies from 11% to 13% (pre-tax). Key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values for each individual CGU are the following: • maturity of the underlying market, market share and volume development in order to determine the revenue mix and growth rate, • level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development, taking into account the nature of the underlying costs and potential economies of scale, • level of capital expenditure in network-related assets, and • discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and inflation-related risks. Management has carried out an impairment test for each individual CGU and concluded that the recoverable amount of the individual CGUs is higher than the carrying amount. Software As at 31 December 2013, the software balance of €37 million (2012: 44) included internally-generated software with a book value of €30 million (2012: 33). The additions to software of €12 million related to self-produced software of €8 million and purchased software of €4 million. They mainly concerned IT investments in the New Logistics Infrastructure within Parcels and software licences for Microsoft and SAP applications. The reclassification of €15 million from other intangibles was due to finalised IT projects. Other intangibles As at 31 December 2013, the other intangible assets of €11 million (2012: 13) related to customer lists of €5 million (2012: 4) and software under construction of €6 million (2012: 9). The estimated amortisation expenses for software and other intangible assets are: • 2014: €29 million, • 2015: €10 million, • 2016: €7 million, • 2017: €0 million, • 2018: €1 million, and • thereafter: €1 million. PostNL does not conduct significant research and development activities and therefore does not incur research and development costs. 90 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position 2 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment: 539 million (2012: 536) Statement of changes Land and Plant and Other Construction Total buildings equipment in progress Depreciation percentage 0%-10% 4%-33% 7%-25% 0% Historical cost 666 545 168 69 1,448 Accumulated depreciation and impairments (428) (433) (136) (997) Balance at 31 December 2011 238 112 32 69 451 Capital expenditure in cash 4 17 11 143 175 (De)consolidation 1 2 3 Disposals (6) (1) (1) (8) Internal transfers and reclassifications 103 45 13 (161) Depreciation (30) (32) (15) (77) Impairments (2) (2) Transfers to assets held for sale (4) (2) (6) Total changes 65 28 10 (18) 85 Historical cost 736 545 177 51 1,509 Accumulated depreciation and impairments (433) (405) (135) (973) Balance at 31 December 2012 303 140 42 51 536 Capital expenditure in cash 7 11 8 64 90 Disposals (1) (1) (2) Internal transfers and reclassifications 60 20 5 (85) Depreciation (30) (34) (15) (79) Impairments (11) (11) Transfers to and from assets held for sale 17 (8) (2) (1) 6 Exchange rate differences (1) (1) Total changes 42 (12) (5) (22) 3 Historical cost 806 456 122 29 1,413 Accumulated depreciation and impairments (461) (328) (85) (874) Balance at 31 December 2013 345 128 37 29 539 (in € millions) Capital expenditures of €90 million (2012: 175) mainly concerned investments within Mail in the Netherlands of €12 million, within Parcels of €63 million and within International of €9 million. The investments mainly concerned land, buildings and sorting machinery for the New Logistics Infrastructure within Parcels, buildings and equipment related to cost savings initiatives and vehicle replacements. Lower investments related to cost savings initiatives explain the lower capital expenditures compared to 2012. The disposals of €2 million (2012: 8) mainly related to the sale of real estate in the Netherlands. The internal transfers and reclassifications of €85 million from construction in progress to land and buildings, plant and equipment and other were caused by the finalisation of central preparation locations, NLI depots within Parcels and sorting machinery. In 2013, depreciation costs amounted to €79 million and were in line with 2012 (€77 million). In 2013, impairment charges amounted to €11 million (2012: 2) and related to real estate in the Netherlands. An amount of €8 million of the impairments is reported within Mail in the Netherlands and an amount of €3 million within PostNL Other. Given the current overall downward pressure on real estate, management reviewed the recoverability of the real estate portfolio and concluded that some individual buildings should be impaired. The recoverable value of the buildings was based on the fair value less costs of disposal, supported by valuations from external professional valuators. In 2013, the transfers from assets held for sale amounted to €6 million (2012: -6) and related to buildings in the Netherlands transferred from assets held for sale back to land and buildings of €17 million that are no longer expected to be disposed of within one year, equipment relating to customer contact services transferred from assets held for sale back to plant and equipment of €2 million and transfers to assets held for sale related to TNT Post UK of €13 million. In 2012, the transfers to assets held for sale related to buildings within Mail in the Netherlands totalling €4 million and to equipment relating to customer contact services totalling €2 million. PostNL Annual Report 2013 91 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position Finance leases included in the property, plant and equipment balance as at 31 December 2013 amounted to €14 million (2012: 13), which fully concerns land and buildings. The minimum lease payments to be paid under these contracts represent the discounted value. Land and buildings under financial leases fully concern leasehold rights and ground rent. The book value of the leasehold rights and ground rent is €14 million (2012: 13), comprising a historical cost of €22 million (2012: 19) with accumulated depreciation of €8 million (2012: 6). Leasehold rights and ground rents expiring: • between 1 and 5 years amount to €1 million (2012: 0), • between 5 and 20 years amount to €13 million (2012: 5), and • between 20 and 40 years amount to €0 million (2012: 8). There are no leasehold and ground rent contracts with indefinite terms. The leasehold rights and ground rent contracts related to land and buildings in the Netherlands. There is no material temporarily idle property, plant or equipment as at 31 December 2013 (2012: 0). 3 Investments in associates Investments in associates: 6 million (2012: 1,373) Stake TNT Express With a 29.8% shareholding in TNT Express as at 1 January 2013, PostNL was assumed to have significant influence in TNT Express and classified the stake in TNT Express as an investment in associates, accounted for based on the equity method. Following the sale of 15% of the outstanding share capital of TNT Express on 6 December 2013, the remaining 14.8% shareholding in TNT Express was transferred from investments in associates to available-for-sale financial assets. The following table presents the changes in the carrying value of the stake in TNT Express. Stake TNT Express 2013 2012 restated Balance at 1 January 1,367 936 Share in net result 47 3 Purchase price adjustments (12) (16) Share in direct equity movements (21) (3) Dividend received (8) (1) Reversal /(impairment) (263) 448 Carrying value before disposal and subsequent transfer 1,110 Disposal of 15% shareholding (507) Book loss at disposal (105) Transfer to available-for-sale financial assets (498) Balance at 31 December 0 1,367 (in € millions) The share in the net result and direct equity movements of TNT Express, €47 and -€21 million respectively (2012: 3 and -3), are derived from the third-quarter 2013 report of TNT Express N.V. as published on 28 October 2013. The purchase price adjustments of -€12 million (2012: -16) include the net amortisation charge of the identified intangibles. In 2013, PostNL received a dividend of €8 million (2012: 1) from TNT Express. Following the withdrawal of UPS' offer in January 2013, the share price of TNT Express declined from €8.43 on 31 December 2012 to €6.85 on 27 September 2013, resulting in an impairment charge of €263 million. In 2012, as a result of the UPS offer, the share price of TNT Express increased from €5.77 on 31 December 2011 to €8.43 on 31 December 2012, leading to an increase in the market value of our stake from €936 million as at 31 December 2011 to €1,367 million as at 31 December 2012. This increase resulted in a reversal of previously-recognised impairments for a net amount of €448 million in 2012. On 6 December 2013, PostNL sold part of its stake in TNT Express at a price of €6.20 per share, resulting in gross cash proceeds of €507 million. The partial disposal consisted of a private placement to institutional investors of 81,743,614 TNT Express ordinary shares (15% of the outstanding share capital of TNT Express). Following the disposal, the remaining 14.8% stake in TNT Express with a carrying value of €498 million (corresponding to a share price of €6.20) was transferred to available-for-sale financial assets. 92 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position The sales transaction resulted in a book loss of €106 million. The book loss on the total stake of 162,130,035 shares mainly consisted of the difference of €105 million between the carrying value of €1,110 million based on a share price of €6.85 and the value of €1,005 million based on the selling price of €6.20 per share. The remaining €1 million loss resulted from incurred expenses of €4 million, partly offset by the positive effect from the recycling of the currency translation and hedge reserve of the total stake in TNT Express of €3 million. In the income statement, the book loss of €106 million has been included as impairment of investments in associates. The impairment of €263 million and book loss of €106 million totalled the impairment of investments in associates of €369 million reported in the income statement. Other investments in associates As at 31 December 2013, all other investments in associates amounted to €6 million (2012: 6) and included €3 million of goodwill (2012: 3). These investments mainly related to minority shareholdings in Germany within the segment International. They included total assets of €23 million (2012: 26), revenues of €104 million (2012: 94) and net profit of €3 million (2012: 3). 4 Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets: 542 million (2012: 0) Stake TNT Express In 2013, following the sale of 15% of the shareholding in TNT Express on 6 December 2013, the remaining 14.8% stake in TNT Express was transferred from investments in associates to available-for-sale financial assets for an amount of €498 million (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). In accordance with IAS 39, the 14.8% stake in TNT Express is considered an available-for-sale financial asset measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value recognised in other comprehensive income. The fair value per 31 December 2013 amounts to €542 million and has been determined by multiplying the closing share price at 31 December 2013 of €6.75 by the total number of issued ordinary shares held by PostNL of 80,386,421. The gain of €44 million has been recorded in other comprehensive income. 5 Inventory Inventory: 8 million (2012: 9) Inventory At 31 December 2013 2012 Raw materials and supplies 1 2 Finished goods 7 7 Total 8 9 (in € millions) Total inventory of €8 million (2012: 9) is valued at historical cost at a total of €10 million (2012: 11) and is stated net of provisions for obsolete items of €2 million (2012: 2). No inventories are pledged as security for liabilities as at 31 December 2013 (2012: 0). In 2013 and 2012, no material write-offs relating to inventories occurred. The balance of inventories expected to be recovered after 12 months is €0 million (2012: 0). PostNL Annual Report 2013 93 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position 6 (Trade) accounts receivable (Trade) accounts receivable: 399 million (2012: 482) (Trade) accounts receivable At 31 December 2013 2012 Trade accounts receivable total 393 445 Allowance for doubtful debt (15) (13) Trade accounts receivable 378 432 VAT receivable 11 36 Other accounts receivable 10 14 Accounts receivable 21 50 Total (trade) accounts receivable 399 482 (in € millions) As at 31 December 2013, the trade accounts receivable amounted to €393 million (2012: 445), of which €197 million (2012: 182) was past due but not individually impaired. The average payment term within PostNL is around 23 days. The total allowance for doubtful debt amounted to €15 million (2012: 13). The main part of the allowance related to a collective loss component established for groups of similar trade accounts receivable balances. This collective loss component is largely based on the ageing of the trade accounts receivable and is reviewed periodically. The credit quality of trade accounts receivable that are neither past due nor individually impaired is in general considered to be good. The total amount of writeoffs is in general limited and totalled €4 million in 2013 (2012: 4). Major customers are financial institutions, publishers, large retailers and the government. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivables mentioned above. PostNL did not pledge the outstanding balances as collateral. The concentration of the trade accounts receivable per customer is limited. The top 10 trade accounts receivable accounted for 11% of the outstanding balance as at 31 December 2013 (2012: 9%). The concentration of the trade accounts receivable portfolio over the different regions can be summarised as follows: the Netherlands €232 million (2012: 221), Germany and Italy €123 million (2012: 95) and the rest of the world €23 million (2012: 23). The trade accounts receivable of TNT Post UK of €79 million (2012: 93) are included in assets held for sale. For the non-trade accounts receivable, no allowance for doubtful debt was required. The increase of the trade accounts receivable in Germany and Italy of €28 million is mainly caused by debtors in Italy. Within Italy, €21 million of the total trade accounts receivable related to Riscossione Sicilia, an Italian tax collection agency for Sicily. Management expects the receivable to be fully recoverable. Although the timing of collection is uncertain, management expects the receivable to be collected within two years. The fair value of the total (trade) accounts receivable approximated its carrying value. The balance of the total (trade) accounts receivable that is expected to be recovered after 12 months is €10 million (2012: 1) and related to Italy. The ageing analysis of the trade accounts receivable past due but not individually impaired is presented below. Ageing trade accounts receivable past due, not impaired At 31 December 2013 2012 Up to 1 month 112 116 2-3 months 49 46 3-6 months 16 10 Over 6 months 20 10 Total 197 182 (in € millions) The movements in the allowance for doubtful debt of trade accounts receivable were as follows: Statement of changes in the allowance for doubtful debt of trade accounts receivable 2013 2012 Balance at 1 January 13 13 Provided for during financial year 8 4 Receivables written off during year as uncollectable (4) (4) Transfers to assets held for sale (2) 0 Balance at 31 December 15 13 (in € millions) 94 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position In 2013, the VAT receivable of TNT Post UK of €10 million is reported as assets held for sale. In 2012, the VAT receivable also included VAT related to the purchase of land for NLI of €6 million. 7 Prepayments and accrued income Prepayments and accrued income: 102 million (2012: 116) Prepayments and accrued income included amounts paid in advance to cover costs that will be charged against income in future years and net revenues not yet invoiced. As at 31 December 2013, prepayments amounted to €6 million (2012: 26) and accrued income to €96 million (2012: 90). The decrease in prepayments and accrued income is mainly caused by reporting TNT Post UK as assets held for sale (€17 million). The balance of prepayments and accrued income that is expected to be recovered after 12 months is zero (2012: 0). 8 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents: 469 million (2012: 391) As at 31 December 2013, cash and cash equivalents comprised cash at bank and in hand of €79 million (2012: 96), short-term bank deposits of €240 million (2012: 75), cash placed into money market funds of €100 million (2012: 120) and cash placed on an on-call deposit account of €50 million (2012: 100). The effective interest rate on cash placed was 0.01% (2012: 0.14%) and the average outstanding amount was €115 million (2012: 61). The individual deposits had an average maturity of 1.4 days (2012: 1.4). The effective interest rate on the money market funds was 0.03% and the average outstanding amount was €89 million (2012: 148). The effective interest rate on the on-call deposit account was 0.26% and the average outstanding amount was €68 million (2012: 100). As at 31 December 2013, included in cash and cash equivalents was €19 million (2012: 25) of restricted cash. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximated the carrying value. 9 Assets classified as held for sale Assets classified as held for sale: 194 million (2012: 63) and liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale: 117 million (2012: 11) As at 31 December 2013, assets classified as held for sale amounted to €194 million (2012: 63). Of these, €27 million (2012: 51) related to buildings held for sale in the Netherlands and €167 million to TNT Post UK. The liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale of €117 million related to TNT Post UK. As at 31 December 2012, assets classified as held for sale of €12 million and liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale of €11 million related to customer contact services. In 2013, PostNL decided to stop the sales process, so customer contact services are no longer reported as assets held for sale. TNT Post UK In December 2013, PostNL reached an agreement with LDC to establish a joint venture, which will allow TNT Post UK to roll out its end-to-end postal delivery service. The joint venture will provide the funding and expertise for the phased implementation of the end-to-end service, following successful trials in London and a recent extension to Manchester. Completion is subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory clearances and is currently expected in the second half of 2014. At completion, PostNL will have a 40% stake in the joint venture. As a result, control will be lost. This resulted in the transfer of the assets and liabilities of TNT Post UK to held for sale at the end of 2013. IFRS 5 'Assets held for sale' requires assets to be valued at the lower of their fair value less costs of disposal and their carrying value. The carrying value equals the net assets of TNT Post UK in the consolidated financial statements. Fair value less costs of disposal is based on the agreement reached with LDC. In 2013, an impairment of €12 million was recorded to align the carrying value to fair value less costs of disposal, taking into account expected rebranding costs of €6 million. Under the new accounting rules for joint ventures (IFRS 11), after completion of the transaction, the financials of the UK activities will be accounted for using the equity method and as a consequence, revenue and costs of the UK are not reflected in the income statement anymore. This will materially impact the reported revenues and operating income of PostNL. In 2013, TNT Post UK accounted for €730 million of revenue and €7 million of profit for the period. The major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale related to TNT Post UK are presented below. The impairment of €12 million is charged PostNL Annual Report 2013 95 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position to the intangible assets that were transferred to assets held for sale for an amount of €25 million (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).

In 2013, an amount of €17 million was transferred back from assets held for sale to property, plant and equipment relating to buildings that are no longer expected to be disposed of within one year. The book value of the buildings sold in 2013 amounted to €6 million, which wholly related to the sale of buildings in the Netherlands. In 2013, impairment charges of assets held for sale of €1 million (2012: 0) related to real estate within Mail in the Netherlands. 10 Equity Equity: -672 million (2012: -292) The consolidated statement of changes in equity can be found on page 73.

PostNL’s articles of association provide for protective preference shares B that can be issued to Foundation Continuity PostNL to serve these interests. The preference shares B have a nominal value of €0.08 and have the same voting rights as PostNL’s ordinary shares. PostNL and Foundation Continuity PostNL have entered into a call option agreement, which enables Foundation Continuity PostNL to acquire a number of preference shares B not exceeding the total issued amount of shares minus one and minus any shares already issued to Foundation Continuity PostNL. The call option agreement is meant as a preventive countermeasure against influences that might threaten the continuity, independence and identity of the company. Preference shares B will be outstanding no longer than is strictly necessary. There are currently no preference shares B issued. The exercise price with respect to the call option is the nominal value of €0.08 per preference share B, although upon exercise only €0.02 per preference share B is required to be paid. The additional €0.06 per preference share B is due at such time as PostNL makes a call for payment by resolution of its Board of Management, and is subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. Foundation Continuity PostNL has credit facilities in place to enable it to pay the exercise price. Six months after the issuance of preference shares B, Foundation Continuity PostNL may require PostNL to convene a General Meeting of Shareholders to discuss cancellation of these shares. However, if within these six months Foundation Continuity PostNL should receive a demand for repayment under the credit facilities referred to above, it may also require PostNL to convene a General Meeting of Shareholders. In accordance with PostNL’s current articles of association, a General Meeting of Shareholders must be convened no more than 12 months after the first date of issuance of any preference shares B to Foundation Continuity PostNL for the ﬁrst time. The agenda for that meeting shall include a resolution relating to the repurchase and/or cancellation of the preference shares B. PostNL has granted to Foundation Continuity PostNL the right to file an application for an inquiry into the policy and conduct of PostNL’s business with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (Ondernemingskamer), whereby the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal may determine immediate provisions, should these be necessary. The members of the board of the Foundation are R. Pieterse (chairman), J.H.M. Lindenbergh, W. van Vonno and M.P. Nieuwe Weme. All members of the board of the Foundation are independent from PostNL. This means that the Foundation is an independent legal entity as referred to in section 5:71 paragraph 1 sub c of the Netherlands Financial Markets Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht). PostNL Annual Report 2013 97 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position Additional paid-in capital As at 31 December 2013, additional paid-in capital of €147 million (2012: 147) is fully exempt for Dutch tax purposes to the extent that this has been paid in by shareholders of the company. Currency translation reserve As at 31 December 2013, the translation reserve amounted to €9 million (2012: 9), reflecting the movement in exchange rate differences on converting subsidiaries in the United Kingdom within the International segment into euros. Hedge reserve As at 31 December 2013, the hedge reserve amounted to -€14 million (2012: -13) and consisted of the fair value timing difference of -€11 million (2012: -9) on the £225/€284 million, £88/€111 million and £13/€16 million cross-currency swaps and the fair value timing difference of -€3 million (2012: -4) on the forward starting swaps, unwound in 2008, to be recycled in the income statement until 2015 (net of taxes). The £225/€284 million and £88/€111 million cross-currency swaps have been entered into to hedge foreign currency exposure on the £313 million eurobonds which were issued in 2008 for an initial amount of £450 million. The £13/€16 million cross-currency swap has been entered into to hedge foreign currency exposure on the £13 million loan provided to a Group company in 2012. The net movements in the hedge reserve during 2013 amounted to -€1 million and included -€10 million related to the change in the value of cross-currency swaps and €9 million that was recycled from the hedge reserve to the income statement (net of taxes). The tax impact on the cash flow hedges included in the hedge reserve as at 31 December 2013 is €5 million (2012: 4). For more information on the cross-currency swaps, see notes 30 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements. Available-for-sale financial assets As at 31 December 2013, the reserve relating to the available-for-sale financial assets amounted to €44 million and relates to the change in value of the remaining 14.8% stake in TNT Express. Other reserves As at 31 December 2013, the other reserves amounted to -€1,670 million (2012: -1,744). In 2013, the other reserves increased by €74 million. This increase resulted from the appropriation of net income from 2012 of €325 million, a negative pension effect within other comprehensive income (net of tax) of -€230 million, the share in other comprehensive income of TNT Express of -€24 million, an amount of €4 million related to share-based compensation plans and -€1 million related to the buy-out of the minority interest in Spring Global Mail. Retained earnings As at 31 December 2013, retained earnings amounted to €770 million (2012: 1,265). In 2013, retained earnings declined by €495 million. This decrease was due to the appropriation of net income from 2012 of €325 million and total profit for the year of -€170 million in 2013. The Board of Management has proposed adding €935 million (2012: 325) to the other reserves. Refer to ‘Other information' on page 157 for more details of this proposal. 11 Pension assets / Provisions for pension liabilities Pension assets: 0 million (2012: 0) and provisions for pension liabilities: 544 million (2012: 535) PostNL operates a number of post-employment benefit plans in Europe. Most of PostNL’s non-Dutch post-employment benefit plans are defined contribution plans. The majority of the Dutch post-employment benefit plans are defined benefit pension plans and consist of a main plan, transitional plans and other pension plans. PostNL’s main Dutch pension plan (main plan), which is externally funded in ‘Stichting Pensioenfonds PostNL’ (main fund), covers the employees subject to PostNL’s collective labour agreement and staff with a personal labour agreement arranged as from 2007 in the Netherlands. The majority of PostNL’s Dutch employees are subject to the collective labour agreement. The plan covers around 91,000 PostNL participants, including around 23,000 pensioners and around 42,000 former employees. 98 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position Under Dutch law, the main plan is managed by an independent legal entity, Stichting Pensioenfonds PostNL, which is not owned or controlled by any other legal entity and which falls under the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and the Autoriteit Financiële Markten (AFM). PostNL and the main fund have agreed on an execution agreement mainly stipulating the financial terms and conditions relevant for the execution of the pension plan. These terms and conditions include the financial consequences of a coverage ratio below the minimum funding requirement. The transitional plans consist of an early retirement scheme and additional arrangements that were agreed between the company and employees following a revision of fiscal regulations applying to Dutch pension plans in 2006. Amendments related to the pension plan funded in Stichting Pensioenfonds PostNL In 2013, PostNL, the trade unions and Stichting Pensioenfonds PostNL reached a pension and financing agreement with regard to the main Dutch pension plan. • PostNL and the trade unions agreed on a new pension scheme following necessary changes resulting from new fiscal regulations. The pension scheme remains a defined benefit average pay scheme. The main changes are an increase in the retirement age to 67 years, a higher accrual percentage and a lower franchise. As a result, the amount over which pension is accrued will increase. • PostNL, the trade unions and the main fund also agreed on a new financing arrangement for the new pension scheme. The pension (cash) contributions are bounded by a minimum and maximum contribution level, as a percentage of the pensionable salary base. The minimum and maximum level is set at 21.5% and 27.5% respectively. Based on the total maximum premium amount, the intended pension accrual can be increased or reduced in any year. The actuarial contributions are calculated by applying a 60-month moving average pension fund discount rate. The resulting contributions are increased by 10% if the coverage ratio is below 120% and by 5% if the coverage ratio is between 120% and 130%. • PostNL and the main fund also agreed on a limitation of PostNL’s obligation for top-up payments in the event of a coverage deficit of a maximum 1.25% of the fund’s plan obligations per year. In determining the limited top-up payment obligation, the resilience of the pension fund will be taken into account. • PostNL agreed on a one-off unconditional contribution into the main fund of €150 million to compensate for the implementation of the limited top-up payment obligation and a conditional budget of €300 million to prevent cutbacks, if any, during the years 2014-2018. The conditional budget is additional to the regular top-up payments of 1.25% at most of the fund’s plan obligations per year. • The unconditional commitment of €150 million and other possible commitments required from the conditional budget of €300 million are payable from the moment PostNL pays out dividend, but at the latest 10 years after the amounts become unconditional, in all cases with a payment term of five years as from that date. The changes to the arrangement will result in a reduction in pension (cash) contributions and reduce the risk and magnitude of top-up payments. All changes apply as of 1 January 2014. All elements of the pension and financing agreements reached have been included in the calculation of the pension plan obligations. The resulting past service costs are reported as part of operating expenses in the income statement. Amendments related to the pension plan funded in Stichting Ondernemingspensioenfonds TNT PostNL is also the sponsoring employer of the pension plan covering the staff members in the Netherlands who have a personal labour agreement before 2007, which is externally funded in ‘Stichting Ondernemingspensioenfonds TNT'. In 2013, PostNL communicated the proposed amendments to the pension scheme, following necessary changes resulting from new fiscal regulations. The pension scheme remains a defined benefit final pay scheme. The main changes are a higher annual accrual rate and a higher retirement age (aimed at age 67). Both the financing arrangement of the new pension scheme and PostNL’s unlimited obligation for top-up payments have not changed. In addition, PostNL communicated the reduction of the transitional arrangements for the relevant employees in line with the original intentions in 2006. This change is comparable to the changes made in 2012 for the relevant employees under the collective labour agreement. The amendments have been included in the calculation of the pension plan obligations. The resulting past service costs are reported as part of operating expenses in the income statement. Amendments related to the pension plan funded in Stichting Pensioenfonds Postbezorgers PostNL PostNL is also the sponsoring employer of the pension plan covering mail deliverers in the Netherlands, which is externally funded in ‘Stichting Pensioenfonds Postbezorgers PostNL’. PostNL Annual Report 2013 99 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position In 2013, PostNL and the trade unions reached an agreement to change the pension scheme from a defined benefit average pay scheme to a defined contribution scheme as of 1 January 2014. The new pension scheme is applicable to all current and future employees. The defined contribution scheme will not be insured by the existing pension fund. As a consequence of no new pension accruals, PostNL has cancelled the execution agreement with the fund, effective 31 December 2014. During 2014, PostNL’s obligation for top-up payments, if any, remains unchanged. The amendments resulted in the decrease of the pension plan obligation to the vested benefit obligation, with the resulting obligation matching the pension plan assets as at 31 December 2013. The resulting past service costs are reported as part of operating expenses in the income statement. Additional restructuring programmes Declining mail volumes force PostNL to make comprehensive changes to its organisation. In 2013, additional to the restructuring programme applicable to production employees, restructuring programmes were initiated for staff and management within operations, the marketing and sales department and head office departments. Allowing for natural attrition and voluntary departures, redundancies of approximately 1,000 FTEs are expected among this group. The impact of the additional restructuring programmes has been included in the calculation of the pension plan obligations. The resulting past service costs are reported as part of operating expenses in the income statement. Further details of the main plan In the main plan, both the employer and the employees contribute to the pension fund. The contributions are based on actuarial calculations per active participant. The total employer contribution to the main fund amounted to €191 million (2012: 212), including top-up payments of €64 million (2012: 81) as a result of the coverage deficit during 2012. By the end of 2013, the coverage ratio of the main fund increased to 111.9% (2012: 102.5%), including the outstanding payment of the unconditional contribution of €150 million by PostNL. As at 31 December 2013, no top-up payments are outstanding. The increased coverage ratio was mainly due to an increase in the fund's long-term interest rate, a decreased longevity outlook and the receivable of €150 million. The fund's coverage ratio as at 31 December 2013 includes the latest longevity outlook, based on recent statistical studies performed by the Dutch Actuarial Association (Actuarieel Genootschap). As at 31 December 2013, the main fund controls around 95% of the PostNL Group plan assets. The returns on plan assets are linked to the strategic investment policy, as annually reported in the asset liability management (ALM) study of the main fund. The ALM study includes 2,000 future scenarios that take into account the relevant standard deviations of, and correlations between, the various asset categories, as derived from historical evidence. Ultimately, the long-term objective is to protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power, and to provide long-term growth of capital without excessive exposure to risk. The duration of the plan liabilities determines the investment strategy. The assets are managed by external investment managers. The main fund establishes the investment policy and strategy, including the selection of investment managers, setting long-term strategic targets and monitoring. The strategic asset mix is a target and not a limitation. The fund may approve components of the asset mix above or below the targeted range. The fund may decide to rebalance or change the asset mix periodically. As at 31 December 2013, the weight of equity and equity derivatives investments amounted to 22%, the weight of fixed interest investments amounted to 63%, the weight of real estate and alternative investments amounted to 11% and the weight of swaps and swaptions investments amounted to 4%. The plan assets may from time to time include investments in PostNL’s own financial instruments through indirect holdings by mutual funds. Around 83% of the main fund's total plan assets have a quoted market price in an active market. The unquoted part relates to investments in investment funds which invest in non-listed assets (for example real estate investments) and non-listed derivates. The main fund's overall investment strategy and exposure includes equity derivatives to preserve part of the upward potential on equity and at the same time be protected against substantial declines in equity valuations. In addition, the main fund uses interest rate derivatives to reduce the net interest exposure on its assets and liabilities. The main fund reports its investment mix and results on the basis of the actual characteristics of the investments. Consequently, the bond investments accompanying the equity derivative strategy are reported within 'Fixed interest and inflation-linked bonds'. 100 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position Asset mix/returns of main pension plan At 31 December Actual mix Strategic mix Return 2013 2013 2013 Equities and equity derivatives 22% 21%1 29.5% Fixed interest and inflation linked bonds 63% 67%2 -1.6% Real estate and alternative investment 11% 12% -1.1% Swaps and swaptions / Contribution to the return 4% -3.0% Total / total weighted average 100% 100% 0.9% 1 Including the actual 2013 investment in equity derivatives. 2 Including the actual 2013 investment in swaps and swaptions.

Movement of the provision for post-employment benefit plans The following table presents an overview of the movement of the provision for post-employment benefit plans during 2013, including the impact from IAS 19R of €1,829 million on the reported provision at 31 December 2012. Included in the provision for pension liabilities are the unfunded defined benefit Trattamento di Fine Rapporto (TFR) in Italy of €9 million (2012: 7).

In 2013, PostNL’s expenses for defined benefit post-employment plans were €6 million (2012: 72), including a positive effect from past service costs of €140 million (2012: 27). The expenses for defined contribution plans were €5 million (2012: 5). Including these charges for defined contribution plans, PostNL's total expenses for post-employment benefit plans amounted to €11 million (2012: 77). The past service costs of €140 million in 2013 consist of a positive effect of €49 million resulting from the additional restructuring programmes, mainly due to the release of conditional obligations within the transitional plans, and a positive effect of €91 million resulting from the amended pension and financing arrangements. In the income statement, the total expenses of €11 million (2012: 77) are included in ‘Salaries, pensions and social security contributions' for an amount of -€8 million (2012: 82), refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and included in ‘Interest and similar expenses for an amount of €19 million (2012: net interest income: 5), refer to note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. For 2014, total expenses for post-employment benefit plans are expected to amount to around €140 million, including €120 million operating expenses and €20 million interest expenses. PostNL Annual Report 2013 101 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position Defined benefit pension cash contributions In 2013, total employer cash contributions for defined benefit post-employment plans amounted to €306 million (2012: 343), including top-up payments of €64 million as a result of the coverage deficit in 2012 (2012: 83). Including the cash outflow for defined contribution plans of €5 million (2012: 5), PostNL's total cash contributions amounted to €311 million (2012: 348). For 2014, total regular employer cash contributions, excluding top-up payments, are expected to amount to around €180 million. Defined benefit pension amounts recognised in other comprehensive income The valuation of PostNL’s pension obligation and the determination of its pension cost are based on assumptions, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each financial year. Actual circumstances may vary from these assumptions, giving rise to a different pension obligation at year-end. In accordance with the revised IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits', these actuarial gains and losses on both the pension obligation and the pension plan assets have to be recognised immediately within Other Comprehensive Income (net of tax). As future actuarial results also have to be recognised immediately and are heavily dependent on interest rate movements and actual investment returns, consolidated equity will show fluctuations when actual developments differ from assumptions. The actuarial losses of €123 million during 2013 is mainly explained by a negative difference of €113 million between the assumed return on plan assets and the actual investment return (see the next table). In accordance with the revised IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits', the assumed return on plan assets equals the discount rate applied in the calculation of the pension obligations at the beginning of the year. The net charge within other comprehensive income amounted to €90 million. Regarding the main pension plan in the Netherlands, the plan and financing amendments in 2013 resulted in a defined benefit pension asset of €36 million. As a result of the application of the pension asset ceiling test, the full pension asset of €36 milion can not be recorded by PostNL. Furthermore, following the regulations on minimum funding requirements, PostNL had to fully provide for the unconditional payment of €150 million resulting from the pension agreement with the main fund. As a result, an adjusting effect of €186 million has been accounted for in the defined benefit provision of this plan. The net charge within other comprehensive income amounted to €140 million. The total net provision for defined benefit post-employment plans of €544 million at 31 December 2013 (2012 restated: 535) consists entirely of a provision for pension liabilities. Detailed reconciliation of the opening and closing balances The following table reconciles the opening and closing balances of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, the funded status and the netted pension provisions, and the employer pension expenses of PostNL's defined benefit post-employment plans. 102 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position Detailed overview of changes in consolidated defined benefit plans 2013 2012 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year (6,750) (5,486) Service costs (125) (96) Interest costs (251) (262) Past service costs 140 27 Actuarial (losses)/gains (9) (1,156) Benefits paid 224 223 Benefit obligation at end of year (6,771) (6,750) Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 6,222 5,569 Assumed return on plan assets 232 267 Employee contributions 9 1 Employer contributions 304 340 Other costs (8) (9) Actuarial (losses)/gains (113) 277 Benefits paid (224) (223) Fair value of plan assets at end of year 6,422 6,222 Change in funded status Funded status at the beginning of year (528) 83 Operating expenses 16 (77) Interest (expenses)/income (19) 5 Employer contributions 304 340 Actuarial (losses)/gains (122) (879) Funded status at end of year (349) (528) Impact of pension asset ceiling (36) Impact of minimum funding requirement (150) Other post-employment benefit plans (9) (7) Netted pension liabilities (544) (535) Components of employer pension expenses Service costs (net of employee contributions) (116) (95) Interest (expenses)/income (19) 5 Past service costs 140 27 Other costs (8) (6) Post-employment benefit income/(expenses) (3) (69) Other post-employment benefit plan expenses (3) (3) Total post-employment benefit income/(expenses) (6) (72) Weighted average assumptions as at 31 December Discount rate 3.5% 3.7% Rate of benefit increases 1.4% 1.5% Life expectancy 65 year old men/women (in years) 21.0/22.8 21.8/23.5 (in € millions) The actuarial losses on the defined benefit obligation of €9 mllion (2012: 1,156) can be splitted into the following developments. • The change in discount rate from 3.7% to 3.5% accounted for €207 million of actuarial losses. During 2012, the discount rate decreased from 4.8% to 3.7%, which resulted in actuarial losses of €1,117 million. • The changes in demographic assumptions accounted for €144 million of actuarial gains (2012: gains of 3). • Experience adjustments accounted for €54 million of actuarial gains (2012: losses of 42). The experience adjustment is the difference between the expected and actual position at year-end, excluding the impact of changes in assumptions. Assumptions PostNL’s pension expense is mainly affected by the discount rate, the rate of benefit increases and the longevity outlook used to measure pension obligations. Management reviews these and other assumptions every year. The measurement date for PostNL’s post-employment benefits is 31 December. Changes in assumptions may occur as a result of economic and market conditions. The discount rate is based on the long-term yield on high quality (AA-rated) corporate bonds, taking into account the duration of the projected pension liabilities of around 19 years. The high quality (AA-rated) corporate bond yield information is sourced from Bloomberg, taking into account a minimum outstanding amount and other defined selection criteria. By applying curve-fitting procedures, a yield curve is generated. Using the full yield curve, the discounted value of the expected future benefit payments is matched with the comparable present value when using a single discount rate. PostNL Annual Report 2013 103 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position The conditional benefit increases within the main plan are based on the (derived) Consumer Price Index. The assumed rate of benefit increases is based on advice, published statistics and the pension plan's ambition level. Assumptions regarding the longevity outlook are based on advice, published statistics and experience per country. The majority of the defined benefit obligation relates to participants in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the average prospective life expectancy of men after retiring at the age of 65 is 21.0 years (2012: 21.8). The equivalent expectancy for women is 22.8 years (2012: 23.5). The applied longevity rates are derived from the mortality table ‘GBM/GBV 2012 – 2062 + CVS experience rates based on postal areas, starting rates 2014 and age corrections 0/0 (male/female)’, as applied by the main fund. Sensitivity analysis of the defined benefit obligation The table below shows the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation at year-end 2013 to deviations in key assumptions (applied in the year-end 2013 valuations), with all other assumptions held unchanged. The sensitivity to life expectancy of +1/-1 year is measured by assuming all plan participants 1 year younger/older. Sensitivity defined benefit obligation %-change in impact on defined assumptions benefit obligation Benefit obligation at end of year 6,771 Discount rate + 0.5% -8.0% Rate of benefit increases + 0.5% +8.8% Life expectancy men/women + 1 yr +2.6% Benefit obligation at end of year 6,771 Discount rate 0.5% +9.0% Rate of benefit increases 0.5% -7.8% Life expectancy men/women 1 yr -2.8% Funded status of funded and unfunded defined benefit plans The table below reconciles the opening and closing balances of the present value of the defined benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets with the provision for post-employment benefit plans.

The estimated utilisation in 2014 is €69 million, in 2015 €59 million, in 2016 €34 million and in 2017 and thereafter €35 million. Other employee benefit obligations As at 31 December 2013, the other employee benefit obligations related to jubilee payments of €22 million and other employee benefits of €3 million. Restructuring As at 31 December 2013, the provision for restructuring programmes amounted to €140 million (2012: 147). The provision related mainly to the Master Plan III restructuring programme for a total of €135 million and other smaller restructuring programmes for a total of €5 million. The additions of €80 million related mainly to the Master Plan restructuring programmes (€75 million) and to a restructuring within International (€3 million). The additions to the Master Plan provision relate to the restructuring of staff and management within operations (€39 million), the marketing & sales department (€12 million) and head office departments (€24 million), and relates to around 780 FTE in total. The restructuring of staff and management within operations and the marketing & sales department resulted from the announcement to adjust the employee base to the increased volume decline within Mail in the Netherlands. The restructuring of head office departments continued in 2013. This programme relates to a number of different departments. The restructuring provision within International resulted from the announcement of Spring Global Mail to restructure part of its marketing & sales and head office activities. The withdrawals of €81 million concerned severance payments under the Master Plan programmes totalling €70 million, settlement payments within Postkantoren B.V. of €7 million, payments for other initiatives within Mail in the Netherlands of €2 million and within other business lines of €2 million. The total withdrawals of €81 million related to a total of 979 FTEs (2012: 1,529), of which 871 FTEs related to the Master Plan programmes and 108 FTEs related to other restructuring programmes. Of the release of €7 million, €6 million related to changes in the Master Plan restructuring programmes, mainly due a decrease in forced redundancies and periodical reassessments of the projected cash costs. The restructuring provisions are discounted against an average discount rate of 1.2% (2012: 1.8%) as they are expected to be utilised mainly during the period 2014-2016. The related interest charges of €1 million have been recorded as part of financial expenses. Claims and indemnities The provision for claims and indemnities includes provisions for claims from third parties with respect to PostNL’s ordinary business activities, as well as indemnities and disputes related to the sale of PostNL’s discontinued operations. More detailed PostNL Annual Report 2013 105 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position information relating to these provisions is not provided, as such information could prejudice the company’s position with respect to these claims and indemnities. Other Other provisions consist of anticipated contributions to the postal fund for unemployment, onerous contracts, dilapidation costs in relation to restructurings and guarantees provided to third parties. The additions of €3 million related mainly to the postal fund for unemployment of €2 million. The withdrawals from the other provisions of €3 million related mainly to the settlement of onerous contracts within operations and Postkantoren B.V. (€2 million). 13 Long-term debt Long-term debt: 1,263 million (2012: 1,615) Carrying amounts and fair value At 31 December 2013 2012 Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Eurobonds 1,224 1,374 1,575 1,817 Financial leases 1 1 1 1 Other loans 3 3 10 10 Derivatives 35 35 29 29 Total long-term debt 1,263 1,413 1,615 1,857 (in € millions) The fair value of long-term interest-bearing debt, net of its current portion, has been determined by calculating the discounted value of the future cash flows (redemption and interest) using the interbank zero coupon curve, adjusted for the basis swap spread. The carrying amounts of the current portion of long-term debt approximated their fair value. The decrease in long term-debt in 2013 is due to the bond-buy back transaction announced and completed in December 2013.

PostNL Annual Report 2013 107 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the consolidated income statement 16 Net sales Net sales: 4,296 million (2012: 4,317) The net sales of PostNL arose from rendering postal and related services to businesses and consumers in the Benelux, United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. Net sales is allocated by the nature of the services provided and geographical area in which the entity records sales and is detailed in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements. 17 Other operating revenue Other operating revenue: 11 million (2012: 13) Other operating revenue covers the sale of goods and rendering of services not related to PostNL’s regular business activities. In 2013, these revenue mainly related to customs and administration revenue for €5 million (2012: 5), package material for €2 million (2012: 1), rental income on temporarily leased-out property for €1 million (2012: 2) and IT advisory revenue for €1 million (2012: 2). 18 Other income Other income: 7 million (2012: 31) Other income mainly included book profits from the sale of property, plant and equipment (mostly within Mail in the Netherlands) for a net amount of €6 million (2012: 14) and a received claim of €1 million. In 2012, other income also included an amount of €15 million of negative goodwill arising from the 2012 acquisition of trans-o-flex (within Parcels). 19 Work contracted out and other external expenses Work contracted out and other external expenses: 2,142 million (2012: 2,140) Work contracted out and other external expenses At 31 December 2013 2012 Subcontractors & other work contracted out 2,466 2,454 Rent & lease expenses 120 124 External temporary staff 130 149 Intercompany expenses (574) (587) Total 2,142 2,140 (in € millions) Work contracted out and other external expenses mainly related to €2,466 million of expenses for subcontractors and other work contracted out in the segments International €1,271 million (2012: 1,261), Mail in the Netherlands €674 million (2012: 683) and Parcels €409 million (2012: 377), all including intercompany expenses. Rent and lease expenses were €120 million (2012: 124) and expenses are roughly evenly spread over all segments. Mail in the Netherlands accounts for €46 million (2012: 73) of the expenses for external temporary staff. Parcels reported €52 million (2012: 40), International €17 million (2012: 15) and PostNL Other €15 million (2012: 21). 108 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement 20 Salaries, pensions and social security contributions Salaries, pensions and social security contributions: 1,288 million (2012: 1,323) Salaries, pensions and social security contributions Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Salaries 1,128 1,080 Defined benefit plans (13) 77 Defined contribution plans 5 5 Pension charges (8) 82 Share-based payments 5 Social security charges 163 161 Total 1,288 1,323 (in € millions) In 2013, salaries of €1,128 million increased by €48 million from €1,080 million in 2012, which is mainly due to the impact of a net addition to other provisions of €73 million in 2013 compared to a net release of €23 million in 2012, offset by a reduction of the workforce following the restructuring programme in the Netherlands. The pension expenses in 2013 included a positive effect from past service costs of €140 million (2012: 27) related to the additional restructuring programmes and the amendments to the defined benefit pension plan following the pension agreements reached. The costs of share-based payments amounted to €5 million, of which €4 million related to the equity-settled performance share plan, temporary share plan and short-term incentive of senior management and €1 million related to the cash-settled bonus/investment matching plan.

The reported employees match the number of personnel paid through payroll. For work contracted out refer to note 19. During 2013, the total headcount of PostNL decreased by 7,131 employees compared to 31 December 2012. This mainly related to the reduction within Mail in the Netherlands of 7,798 employees due to the impact of volume decline, cost savings initiatives and the quality recovery measures in 2012, partly offset by an increase of 1,416 employees within International mainly due to the end-to-end services into South West London and Manchester in the United Kingdom. At the end of 2013, there were 2,427 people (2012: 2,527) employed by joint ventures, of whom 424 employees (2012: 535) were on the payroll of Dutch companies, primarily within Bruna B.V. (a 100% subsidiary of Postkantoren B.V.), and 2,003 employees (2012: 1,992) were on the payroll of HIM Holtzbrinck in Germany. Apart from the headcount of employees, the labour force is also measured in FTEs based on the hours worked divided by the local standard. In 2013, the average number of FTEs decreased by 2,268 FTEs compared to 2012.

It also included a total of €441,706 crisis tax (‘crisisheffing’) charged on salaries above €150,000 in 2012 for all current and former members of the Board of Management. 4 Ms Verhagen was appointed to the position of CEO as of 24 April 2012; the base salary has been adjusted retrospectively to a base salary of €625,000 as of the appointment date. 5 Due to the notice period of six months, Mr Koorstra's contract ended on 1 November 2012. The figures presented relate to the period January-October 2012. 6 Mr Aben resigned as member of the Board of Management on 1 November 2012, in connection with his retirement on 1 March 2013. As advisor to the Board of Management, no changes were made to his contractual arrangements prior to his retirement date. Base salary As adopted at the 2013 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 16 April 2013, the annual base salaries for members of the Board of Management were set at €625,000 for Ms Verhagen, CEO, and €475,000 for Mr Bos, CFO. The base salaries are in line with the remuneration policy 2013. Accrued for short-term incentive The short-term incentive represents a potential reward of 37.5% of the annual base salary which is based on challenging but achievable annual targets. Individual targets can only contribute to the short-term incentive payout if they are fully met, which means there is no stretch and no threshold on the annual targets. This short-term incentive plan rewards with a yearly cash payment reflecting the realised achievements of targets. The focus areas for the short-term incentive are in line with the current remuneration policy and represent a multi-stakeholder approach, with 60% financial targets and 40% nonfinancial targets. PostNL accounts for the short-term incentive payments on the basis of the accrued short-term incentive for the performance of the year reported. In 2013, an amount of €412,500 relating to the 2013 short-term incentive of the Board of Management was accrued for. In accordance with the 2013 remuneration policy, this amount will be paid in cash in 2014. In 2013, no amount was paid in relation to the short-term incentive to the members of the Board of Management, due to the fact that they waived their variable remuneration opportunity for 2012. Accrued for long-term incentive The total share-based payment costs relating to the long-term incentive for the members of the Board of Management amounted to €85,936 (2012: 3,218) and related for 2013 to the performance share plan and to the one-off investment/ matching plan as shown below. Performance share plan As of 2013, the Board of Management is awarded a long-term incentive. The long-term incentive represents a potential reward of 37.5% of the annual base salary in the form of a performance share plan that contains long-term (three-year), (internal) financial targets. The performance share plan contains the following characteristics: • it is a conditional equity-settled share plan based on three-year internal financial targets, • shares are conditionally allocated to the Board of Management from 2013 onwards, • a conditional dividend equivalent is added to the conditional shares equal to the dividend rights of ordinary shares, • the conditional shares and their conditional dividend equivalents will vest after a performance period of three years, • vesting is subject to the extent to which the long-term targets have been achieved, • if a member of the Board of Management leaves the company during the performance period due to circumstances involving fraud or gross misbehaviour, any accrued rights on the long-term incentive plan are void, and • if a member of the Board of Management leaves the company due to other reasons, a pro rata performance and timebased vesting applies. PostNL Annual Report 2013 111 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement In compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the members of the Board of Management may not sell their PostNL shares for another period of two years (on top of the three-year performance period) from the date of vesting or the end of their employment, although any sale of shares for the purpose of using the proceeds to pay for the tax due at vesting of these shares is exempted. For compliance reasons, a sale of shares may not occur earlier than six months after termination of the employment agreement.

In 2013, an amount of €78,327 was expensed for the cost of performance shares. The costs are determined by multiplying the number of granted performance shares by the fair value of such shares on the date of the grant (€1.753) and by taking into account expected vesting percentages. The costs are amortised over the vesting period. For the 2013 grant, the vesting period is from 8 May 2013 to 8 May 2016. One-off investment/matching plan In 2011, the Supervisory Board decided to apply a voluntary one-off investment/matching plan in which the cash proceeds from the unwinding of the TNT bonus/matching plan, performance share plan and option plan could be invested in PostNL shares. The participants could elect to invest from their net unwinding cash compensation an amount equal to 25% or 50% of their total gross unwinding-related sum (but not more than the net proceeds of these) in PostNL shares. On the same date these shares were purchased, the participant received, free of charge, a matching right in shares, representing the value in cash of half the number of investment shares (matching on a 1: 0.5 basis). This matching right will vest and the cash value of the shares comprising the matching right will be paid after three years, provided that the participant has remained an employee throughout and still owns at least 50% of his/her investment shares. If, prior to vesting, the participant has sold more than half of his/her investment shares, the matching right will forfeit in full. If the participant has sold 50% or less of his/her investment shares, the number of shares comprising the matching right will be reduced proportionally. The cash sum of the matching rights will be subject to any applicable payroll withholding taxes.

The fair value of the one-off investment/matching plan grants based on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam share price of PostNL on the reporting date amounted to €4.15 (2012: 2.92). The liabilities arising from the share-based payment transaction, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted and the extent to which the employee had rendered service, amounted to €11,712 as at 31 December 2013 (2012: 4,103). Accrued for temporary transition plan The temporary transition plan compensates the gap arising in the years 2013-2015 and provides for an annual award of restricted shares during three years, subject to the provision of continued employment. The restricted shares will be granted on the basis of the same annual achievement of targets as applicable to the short-term incentive. Total share-based payment costs relating to the short-term incentive for the members of the Board of Management amounted to €412,500 (2012: 0) and related to the temporary transition plan. In accordance with the 2013 remuneration policy, this amount will be granted and paid in PostNL shares in 2014. In compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, current and former members of the Board of Management may not sell their PostNL shares before the earlier of five years from the date of grant or the end of their employment, although any sale of shares for the purpose of using the proceeds to pay for the tax due at vesting of these shares is exempted. For compliance reasons, a sale of shares may not occur earlier than six months after termination of the employment agreement. 112 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement Other periodic compensation Other periodic compensation included company costs related to tax and social security, company car and other costs. It also included a total of €127,857 (2012: 210,326) crisis tax (‘crisisheffing’) charged on salaries above €150,000 in 2013 for the current members of the Board of Management. Pension costs The pension costs consist of the service costs for the reported year, net of employee contributions. The increase in pension costs is mainly explained by an increased salary base and a decreased discount rate, both from year-end 2011 (for the costs in 2012) to year-end 2012 (for the costs in 2013). All members of the Board of Management are participants in a career average defined benefit scheme. Loans, advance payments or guarantees No loans, advance payments or guarantees were granted to members of the Board of Management in 2013 (2012: nil). Remuneration of senior management Short-term incentive The short-term incentive for senior management represents a potential reward of a percentage of the annual base salary (the percentage depending on the job level), which is based on challenging but achievable annual targets. As of 2013, 50% of the realised achievements of targets will be paid in cash and 50% will be paid in PostNL shares in the following year. Shares will be granted unconditionally and will be delivered without restrictions or a restricted period, other than those defined in the PostNL insider trading policy. The 50% of the short-term incentive settled in shares is accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment. The total share-based payment costs relating to this short-term incentive amounted to €3.3 million in 2013. This amount will be granted and paid in PostNL shares in 2014. Performance share plan As of 2013, a selected group of members of senior management is awarded a long-term incentive. The long-term incentive represents a potential reward of 37.5% of the annual base salary in the form of a performance share plan that contains longterm (three-year), (internal) financial targets. The company sees the long-term incentive as part of the remuneration package for this selected group of senior management. It is aimed particularly at aligning their interests with the long-term interests of the company and shareholders. The performance share plan contains the following characteristics: • it is a conditional equity-settled share plan based on three-year internal financial targets, • shares are conditionally allocated to a selected group of the members of senior management from 2013 onwards, • a conditional dividend equivalent is added to the conditional shares equal to the dividend rights of ordinary shares, • the conditional shares and their conditional dividend equivalents will vest after a performance period of three years, • vesting is subject to the extent to which the long-term targets have been achieved, • if a participant leaves the company due to circumstances involving fraud or gross misbehaviour, any accrued rights on the long-term incentive plan are void, and • if a participant leaves the company due to other reasons, a pro rata performance and time-based vesting applies. Year Number outstanding Granted during Settled during Forfeited during Number outstanding 1 Jan 2013 20131 2013 2013 31 Dec 2013 Performance share plan 2013 320,865 320,865 Total 0 320,865 0 0 320,865 1 The number of conditional shares is based on 37.5% of the annual base salary divided by the five-day average NYSE Euronext Amsterdam share price of PostNL prior to the grant date (€1.744). In 2013, an amount of €106,245 was expensed for the cost of performance shares. The costs are determined by multiplying the number of granted performance shares by the fair value of such shares on the date of the grant (€1.753) and by taking into account expected vesting percentages. The costs are amortised over the vesting period. For the 2013 grant, the vesting period is from 8 May 2013 to 8 May 2016. Bonus/matching share plan Since 2011, all senior management have had the opportunity, on a voluntary basis, to participate in a bonus/matching plan. If they do, they are paid 100% of their bonus in cash and can convert 25% as a grant of PostNL shares with an associated matching right if at least 50% of the shares are kept for three years. The company sees the bonus/matching plan as part of the remuneration package for the members of senior management, and it is particularly aimed at further aligning their PostNL Annual Report 2013 113 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement interests with the interests of shareholders. At the discretion of the Supervisory Board, grants are made on an annual basis in accordance with the bonus/matching plan which has been approved by the Supervisory Board. The significant aspects of the plan are: • bonus shares are purchased from the participant’s net income using 25% of the gross bonus amount and bonus shares are delivered upon the grant of the right on matching shares, • the number of bonus shares is calculated by dividing 25% of an individual’s gross annual bonus relating to the preceding financial year by the share price on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam on the date the grant is made (2013: €1.75 per share; 2012: €3.34 per share; 2011: €6.76 per share), • the rights to matching shares are granted free of charge and the number of shares is equal to the number of bonus shares (job level A) or twice the number of bonus shares (job level B and above), • the matching rights vest three years after the delivery of the bonus shares. The cash value of the shares comprising the matching rights will be paid out for each bonus share that has been retained for three years, • for each bonus share that is sold within three years, the associated right to one matching share lapses. If more than 50% of the bonus shares are sold within three years, the entire right to matching shares lapses with immediate effect, • where a participant leaves the company for certain reasons (retirement, certain reorganisations, disability or death), the right to matching shares will vest immediately and he/she can exercise his/her right pro rata, and • a participant loses the right to exercise his/her right on matching shares when he/she leaves the company for reasons other than those mentioned. The exercise of the rights to matching shares is subject to the PostNL rules concerning the prevention of use of inside information. All awards under this plan are cash-settled. The table below summarises the status of the number of outstanding rights on the bonus/matching plan (and the limited amount of rights on the one-off investment/matching plan) granted to senior managers in the PostNL Group. Bonus/matching plan senior management PostNL 2013 Year Number Granted during Settled during Forfeited during Number outstanding 2013 2013 2013 outstanding 1 Jan 2013 31 Dec 2013 Matching rights 2011 192,919 (39,654) (19,664) 133,601 2012 351,786 (53,898) (69,781) 228,107 2013 328,323 (3,125) (16,441) 308,757 Total 544,705 328,323 (96,677) (105,886) 670,465 The fair value of the bonus/matching plan rights based on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam share price of PostNL on the reporting date amounted to €4.15 (2012: 2.92). The liabilities arising from the share-based payment transactions, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted and the extent to which the employees had rendered service, amounted to €445,787 (2012: 260,357) for the 2011 bonus/matching plan, €447,026 (2012: 193,896) for the 2012 bonus/matching plan and €242,031 (2012: 0) for the 2013 bonus/matching plan as at 31 December 2013. Financing of equity-settled plans For all equity-settled and cash-settled share plans, PostNL intends to perform the settlement (or in case of cash-settled plans, fund the settlement) via the issuance of new shares. Accordingly, the company does not need to actively hedge the risk in connection with its obligations. As a result, the company did not purchase any additional shares in 2013 (2012: 0) to cover its obligations under the existing share plans. As at 31 December, the total number of shares held for this purpose was nil (2012: 0). 114 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement 21 Depreciation, amortisation and impairments Depreciation, amortisation and impairments: 132 million (2012: 115) Depreciation, amortisation and impairments Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Amortisation of intangible assets 29 27 Depreciation property, plant and equipment 79 77 Impairment of property, plant and equipment 11 2 Impairment of assets held for sale 13 9 Total 132 115 (in € millions) In 2013, the amortisation of intangible assets of €29 million (2012: 27) related to software for €27 million (2012: 25) and other intangibles for €2 million (2012: 2).

The 2012 impairment of assets held for sale of €9 million related to customer contact services within Mail in the Netherlands. 22 Other operating expenses Other operating expenses: 181 million (2012: 201) The other operating expenses consist of IT, communication, office, travel, consulting and training expenses and other shared services costs. In 2013, total PwC fees amounted to €2.5 million (2012: 2.7). The table below presents the total PostNL Group-incurred PwC fees, which can be divided into the following categories: Audit fees Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Audit fees 2.2 2.4 Audit related fees 0.3 0.3 Tax advisory fees 0.0 0.0 Other fees 0.0 0.0 Total 2.5 2.7 (in € millions) Audit fees include fees from the audit of the financial statements, the corporate responsibility reports and the regulatory audit. Audit-related services include specific audit procedures for employee benefit plan audits and consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting matters not classified as audit. In accordance with Dutch legislation, article 2:382a of the Dutch Civil Code, the total audit and audit-related fees charged by the auditor PwC based in the Netherlands amounted to €2.3 million (2012: 2.5). 23 Net financial expenses Net financial expenses: 174 million (2012: 99) Interest and similar expenses Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Interest expenses (152) (107) Interest on net defined benefit pension liabilities (19) (22) Hedge reserve recycled to profit and loss (12) (2) Net foreign exchange gains (1) (1) Total (184) (132) (in € millions) In 2013, the interest expenses of €152 million (2012: 107) mainly consisted of ordinary interest expenses on long-term borrowings of €96 million (2012: 98), financial expenses on early repurchased long-term borrowings of €50 million (2012: 0), interest on other provisions of €1 million (2012: 4), gross-up of notional cash pools of €1 million (2012: 2), interest on taxes of PostNL Annual Report 2013 115 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement €1 million (2012: 1) and €3 million bank charges (2012: 2). The financial expenses on early repurchased long-term borrowings related to the difference between the nominal value and the repurchase price (market value) of bonds repurchased at the date of the bond buy-back transaction of €50 million. Interest expenses on net defined benefit pension liabilities amounted to €19 million (2012: 22). The amount of the hedge reserve recycled to profit and loss increased from €2 million in 2012 to €12 million in 2013 due to €8 million related to the recycling of part of the hedge reserve at bond buy-back date and €2 million related to the recycling of the hedge reserve due to partial non-efficiency of the hedge of £313 million eurobonds caused by accounting adjustments required under IFRS 13. The hedge expenses of €12 million are reflected in the hedge reserve net of tax for €9 million, see note 10. Interest and similar income Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Interest income 10 6 Interest on net defined benefit pension assets 27 Total 10 33 (in € millions) In 2013, interest and similar income amounted to €10 million (2012: 33). This amount included €2 million (2012: 0) of fair value adjustments to reflect own credit risk as required by IFRS 13, €1 million (2012: 3) of interest income on banks, loans and deposits (of which €1 million (2012: 2) related to a gross-up of notional cash pools), €1 million (2012: 0) of income from exceptional sources such as sub-let of property or penalties and €6 million (2012: 0) of interest on taxes. In 2012, an amount of €3 million represented the change in the value of fair value hedges. In 2012, interest income on net defined benefit pension assets amounted to €27 million. In accordance with IFRS, the 2013 interest income on cash pools of €1 million (2012: 2) and interest expense on cash pools are reported on a gross basis as part of interest expense as well as interest income. In accordance with IFRS 13, the credit risk adjustments have been made to the fair value of the financial instruments open at the reporting date and are included in the interest income as above. 24 Income taxes Income taxes: 67 million (2012: 74) In 2013, income taxes amounted to €67 million (2012: 74), or -65.0% (2012: 10.1%) of the profit before income taxes of -€103 million (2012: 731). Effective income tax rate Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Dutch statutory income tax rate 25.0 25.0 Adjustment regarding effective income tax rates other countries 1.2 0.7 Weighted average statutory tax rate 26.2 25.7 Tax effects of: Non and partly deductible costs 1.3 0.6 Non deductible impairments 1.3 0.8 Other 0.2 (2.1) Effective income tax rate before impact stake Express 29.0 25.0 Impact stake Express (94.0) (14.9) Effective income tax rate (65.0) 10.1 (in percentages) Income taxes differ from the amount calculated by multiplying the Dutch statutory corporate income tax rate by the profit before income taxes. The effective income tax rate was -65.0% (2012: 10.1%). In 2013, the statutory income tax rate in the Netherlands was 25.0% (2012: 25.0%). In 2013, the effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by the non-taxable results of the stake in TNT Express of -€334 million (2012: 435). Excluding the impact of the stake in TNT Express, the profit before income taxes would have been €231 million (2012: 296) with a corresponding effective income tax rate of 29.0% (2012: 25.0%). 116 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement The effective income tax rate before the impact of the stake in TNT Express of 29.0% was mainly caused by the balance of differences between Dutch and local tax rates in other countries (1.2%), non-deductible and partly deductible costs predominantly in the Netherlands (1.3%), a non-deductible impairment on assets classified as held for sale relating to TNT Post UK (1.3%), and certain items included in the line ‘Other’ (0.2%). The line ‘Other’ consists mainly of the combined impact of irrecoverable tax losses for which no deferred tax assets could be recognised and several prior year adjustments that positively affected the effective income tax rate. Income tax expense consists of the following: Income taxes Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Current tax expense (20) (27) Changes in deferred taxes 87 101 Total income taxes 67 74 (in € millions) The current tax expense amounted to -€20 million (2012: -27). The difference between the total income taxes in the income statement and the current tax expense is due to timing differences. These differences are recognised as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. At 31 December 2013, the income tax receivable amounted to €1 million (2012: 4) and the income tax payable amounted to €59 million (2012: 28). In 2013, PostNL received income taxes totalling €55 million (2012: 40 paid); see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements. The following table shows the movements in deferred tax assets in 2013: Statement of changes deferred income tax assets Provisions Property, plant Losses carried Other Total and equipment forward Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2011 0 1 12 7 20 Changes via other comprehensive income 167 167 Changes via income statement (119) (2) 4 (117) Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2012 48 1 10 11 70 Changes via other comprehensive income 77 77 Changes via income statement (97) (2) 8 (91) Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2013 28 1 8 19 56 (in € millions) Of the deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2013, €19 million (2012: 6) is to be recovered within 12 months and €37 million (2012: 64) after 12 months. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented net in the balance sheet if PostNL has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxation authority. The total accumulated losses available for carry forward at 31 December 2013 amounted to €156 million (2012: 144). With these losses carried forward, future tax benefits of €48 million could be recognised (2012: 42). Tax deductible losses give rise to deferred tax assets at the statutory tax rate in the relevant country. Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that they will be realised. The probability of the realisation is impacted by uncertainties regarding the realisation of such benefits, for example as a result of the expiration of tax losses carried forward and projected future taxable income. As a result PostNL has not recognised €40 million (2012: 32) of the potential future tax benefits and has recorded deferred tax assets of €8 million at the end of 2013 (2012: 10). The expiration of total accumulated losses is presented in the table below: Expiration of accumulated losses for carry forward arrangements income tax 2014 0 2015 1 2016 1 2017 3 2018 and thereafter 36 Indefinite 115 Total 156 (in € millions) PostNL Annual Report 2013 117 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement The following table shows the movements in deferred tax liabilities in 2013: Statement of changes deferred income tax liabilities Provisions Property, plant Other Total and equipment Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2011 284 54 3 341 Effect of adoption IAS19R (231) (231) Deferred tax liabilities at 1 January 2012 53 54 3 110 Changes via other comprehensive income (53) (53) Changes via income statement (14) (2) (16) Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2012 0 40 1 41 Changes via other comprehensive income Changes via income statement (3) (1) (4) Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2013 0 37 0 37 (in € millions) Of the deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2013, an amount of €0 million (2012: 0) is to be settled within 12 months and an amount of €37 million (2012: 41) after 12 months. 118 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the consolidated statement of cash flows 25 Net cash (used in)/from operating activities Net cash (used in)/from operating activities: 65 million (2012: -56) Net cash from operating activities increased by €121 million from -€56 million in 2012 to €65 million in 2013. The adjustments to profit/(loss)before income taxes for non-cash transactions in the statement of cash flows relate to depreciation, amortisation and impairments, share-based payments, investment income and changes in provisions. Cash generated from operations The cash generated from operations increased from €83 million in 2012 to €160 million in 2013. The increase of €77 million was mainly explained by: • profit before income tax adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation, amortisation and impairments, share-based payments and total investment income of €53 million, • change in pension liabilities of -€52 million, • change in other provisions of €120 million, and • change in working capital of -€44 million. The proﬁt before income taxes of -€103 million (2012: 731) adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation, amortisation and impairments of €132 million (2012: 115), share-based payments of €4 million (2012: 0) and total investment income of €501 million (2012: -365) amounted to €534 million, which is €53 million higher than in 2012 (€481 million). The change in pension liabilities decreased by €52 million from -€266 million in 2012 to -€318 million in 2013 and mainly reflects the difference between the total non-cash employer pension expense for the post-employment defined benefit plans of -€13 million (2012: 77) and the comparable total cash contributions totalling €306 million (2012: 343). In 2013, the cash contributions include top-up payments of €64 million in total (2012: 83). The change in other provisions increased by €120 million from -€132 million in 2012 to -€12 million in 2013 and reflects the difference between the recorded costs for provisions (net amount of additions and releases) of €76 million (2012: -21) and the withdrawals of €88 million (2012: 111). These withdrawals related mainly to restructuring settlements for cost savings initiatives and several other smaller restructuring programmes. The change in working capital decreased by €44 million from €0 million in 2012 to -€44 million in 2013. In 2013, the change in working capital worsened mainly due to a reduction in payables within Mail in the Netherlands and PostNL Other. Interest paid The total cash-out for interest paid in 2013 amounted to €150 million (2012: 99). In 2013, interest paid mainly included interest on PostNL’s long-term borrowings of €97 million (2012: 92), interest compensation paid as a result of the bond buyback transaction of €50 million, interest related to income taxes of €0 million (2012: 3) and other bank charges of €2 million (2012: 2). In addition, interest payments of €1 million (2012: 2) on notional cash pools were included, which in accordance with IFRS, is reported on a gross basis (and offset in received interest). Income taxes received/(paid) PostNL received income taxes totalling €55 million (2012: 40 paid), which includes refunds on preliminary prior year tax assessments in the Netherlands relating to timing differences totalling €74 million. 26 Net cash (used in)/from investing activities Net cash (used in)/from investing activities: 416 million (2012: -156) Interest received In 2013, interest received amounted to €6 million (2012: 11) and included interest received on income taxes of €4 million (2012: 7) and interest received on short-term bank balances and deposits of €2 million (2012: 4), of which €1 million (2012: 2) related to a gross-up on notional cash pools, which is offset in the interest paid. Dividend received In 2013, the cash inflow for dividend of €9 million (2012: 2) mainly related to dividend received from the stake in TNT Express and from minority shareholdings in Germany. PostNL Annual Report 2013 119 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of cash flows Acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures (net of cash) In 2013, no cash was involved with the acquisition of Group companies or joint ventures (2012: 15, for the acquisition of trans-o-flex). Investments in associates In 2013, the investments in associates amounted to €1 million, mainly relating to additional investments in Scoupy B.V. (2012: 1, for the acquisition of a 40% share in Scoupy B.V.). Disposal of associates In 2013, proceeds from the disposal of associates amounted to €505 million (2012: 0) relating to the sale of 15% of the shares of TNT Express. The amount consists of gross cash proceeds of €507 million reduced by bank fees of €2 million that were paid in 2013. Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment In 2013, capital expenditures on other intangible assets of €27 million (2012: 29) mostly related to software including prepayments for software. The capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment amounting to €90 million (2012: 175) mainly related to the New Logistics Infrastructure within Parcels, cost savings initiatives and replacements. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash generated from operations and are part of strict cash control and review. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment In 2013, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment amounted to €14 million (2012: 27) and mainly related to the sale of several buildings from PostNL Real Estate B.V. and PostNL Real Estate Development B.V. totalling €13 million (2012: 26). Other changes in (financial) fixed assets In 2012, the other changes in (financial) fixed assets of -€2 million mainly related to the non-consolidated part of a new loan to the joint venture in HIM Holtzbrinck. Changes in non-controlling interests In 2012, the changes in non-controlling interests of -€4 million related to a repayment of capital of €3 million to TNT Post GmbH & Co. KG, a 71% investment of PostNL, and the buy-out of minority interests in subsidiaries of TNT Post UK of €1 million. 27 Net cash (used in)/from financing activities Net cash (used in)/from financing activities: -367 million (2012: -66) Changes related to non-controlling interests In 2013, changes related to non-controlling interests amounted to -€3 million (2012: -2) and related to the buy-out of the minority interest in Spring Global Mail. In 2012, the amount of €2 million related to the buy-out of minority interests in subsidiaries of TNT Post UK. Proceeds from and repayments of long-term borrowings In 2013, the total net proceeds from and repayments of long-term borrowings amounted to -€362 million (2012: 4) and mainly related to the bond buy-back transaction with a nominal value of €344 million and the partial settlement of the related cross-currency swap of €18 million. In 2012, the amount of €4 million related to some small loans in International. Proceeds from and repayments of short-term borrowings In 2013, the total net proceeds from and repayments of short-term borrowings amounted to €0 million (2012: -67). In 2012, the repayments of €67 million mainly related to a repayment of €30 million of the short-term part of a long-term loan and to the net of increases and decreases on outstanding local short-term debt, of which -€31 million was in the United Kingdom. Repayments of finance leases In 2013, total repayments related to redemptions on finance lease contracts amounted to €2 million (2012: 1). 120 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Additional notes 28 Business combinations (No corresponding ﬁnancial statement number) In 2013, PostNL did not acquire new business by the acquisition of the shares of other entities. 29 Commitments and contingencies (No corresponding ﬁnancial statement number) Off-balance sheet commitments At 31 December 2013 2012 Rent and operating lease 240 301 Capital expenditure 54 44 Purchase commitments 24 30 Pension top up invoices 64 (in € millions) As at 31 December 2013, €149 million of the commitments indicated above are of a short-term nature (2012: 212). Rent and operational lease contracts In 2013, operational lease expenses (including rental) in the consolidated income statement amounted to €120 million (2012: 124). There were no material individual lease contracts as at 31 December 2013. Future payments on non-cancellable existing lease contracts mainly relating to real estate, computer equipment and other equipment are as follows: Repayment schedule rent/operational leases At 31 December 2013 2012 Less than 1 year 81 99 Between 1 and 2 years 62 69 Between 2 and 3 years 35 50 Between 3 and 4 years 21 27 Between 4 and 5 years 15 18 Thereafter 26 38 Total 240 301 of which guaranteed by a third party/customers 5 1 (in € millions) Capital expenditure As at 31 December 2013, commitments in connection with capital expenditure amounted to €54 million (2012: 44) and are related to property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to projects within the operations of Mail in the Netherlands (sorting machines) and the New Logistics Infrastructure of Parcels. Purchase commitments As at 31 December 2013, PostNL had unconditional purchase commitments of €24 million (2012: 30), primarily related to various service and maintenance contracts. These service and maintenance contracts are primarily for information technology, security, salary registration and cleaning. Commitments for pension top-up invoices As at 31 December 2013, no unconditional commitments relating to pension deficits existed. The €64 million outstanding 2012 top-up invoice was paid in the first quarter of 2013. Contingent tax liabilities Multinational groups of the size of PostNL are exposed to varying degrees of uncertainty related to tax planning and regulatory reviews and audits. PostNL accounts for its income taxes on the basis of its own internal analyses, supported by external advice. PostNL continually monitors its global tax position, and whenever uncertainties arise, assesses the potential consequences and either accrues the liability or discloses a contingent liability in its financial statements, depending on the strength of the company’s position and the resulting risk of loss. PostNL Annual Report 2013 121 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes Guarantees As at 31 December 2013, PostNL, on behalf of its subsidiaries, had various parental and bank guarantees outstanding. However, none (2012: 0) resulted in an off-balance sheet commitment for the Group as the relating obligations to external parties have already been recognised by these subsidiaries following their ordinary course of business. Contingent legal liabilities Ordinary course litigation The company is involved in several legal proceedings relating to the normal conduct of its business, such as claims for loss of goods, delays in delivery, trademark infringements, subcontracting and employment issues, and general liability. The majority of these claims are for amounts below €1 million and are insured and/or provided for. PostNL does not expect any liability arising from any of these legal proceedings to have a material effect on its operational results, liquidity, capital resources or ﬁnancial position. The company believes it has provided for all probable liabilities deriving from the normal course of business. 30 Financial risk management (No corresponding financial statement number) PostNL’s activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks, such as market risks (including foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. All these risks arise in the normal course of business and PostNL therefore uses various techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate them. The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding PostNL’s exposure to the financial risks described above. There are certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a parallel fashion and instantaneously. At the same time, for example, the impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures and vice versa is ignored. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that would normally arise from the market shifts assumed. PostNL uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging currency and interest exposures. The company enters into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with its underlying exposures and does not take positions independent of these exposures. None of these financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take speculative positions. Financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Management. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risk in close cooperation with operating units. The Board of Management provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Periodic reporting on financial risks is embedded in the overall risk framework and is provided to the Board of Management in a structural way. Interest rate risk PostNL identifies interest rate risk associated with its financial assets and borrowings. For the financial effects of movements in interest rates on the company's pension obligations, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. A minor part of PostNL’s borrowings is against floating interest rates. These floating interest rates may fluctuate substantially and could have an adverse effect on PostNL’s financial results in any given reporting period. Due to the minor size of floating interest borrowings in the total structure of PostNL’s borrowings, this effect is considered virtually negligible. Borrowings issued at floating interest rates expose the company to the risk of increasing interest costs (cash flow interest risk). Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the company to the risk of incurring high interest costs should interest rates fall in future (fair value interest risk). PostNL’s financial assets are on average of such a short-term nature that they bear no significant fair value interest risk, but do cause cash flow interest rate risks. Group policy is to significantly limit the impact of interest fluctuations over a term of seven years as a percentage of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. As at 31 December 2013, PostNL’s gross interest-bearing borrowings, including ﬁnance lease obligations, totalled €1,270 million (2012: 1,618), of which €1,270 million (2012: 1,615) was at ﬁxed interest rates. Although PostNL generally enters into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives in order to attempt to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to increased operating or financing costs. At the end of 2013, PostNL did not have any interest rate swaps open. At 31 December 2013, if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1% higher with other variables held constant, the profit before income tax would have been €5 million higher (2012: 4). As virtually all debts are at fixed rates, the increase in the rate will not affect the cost base. The potential profit increase is entirely attributable to interest income on the 122 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes cash and cash equivalents. Equity would be affected by €0 million (2012: 0), due to the change in the interest curve projection applied for the calculation of the fair value of the £225/€284 million, £88/€111 million and £13/€16 cross-currency swaps, as well as the €5 million (2012: 4) impact on profit before income taxes (see also note 31 to the consolidated financial statements). Foreign currency exchange risk PostNL has international operations that generate foreign currency exchange risks arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, investments and divestments in foreign currencies other than functional currencies of the respective business units of PostNL, irrespective of whether it is the euro (PostNL’s functional and reporting currency) or another functional currency. Group Treasury matches and manages the intragroup and external financial exposures. Although the company generally enters into hedging arrangements and other contracts to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to increased operating or financing costs. The main currencies of PostNL’s external hedges are the British pound and US dollar, of which the 2013 exchange rates to euro are shown below: Exchange rates main foreign currency Year Year end closing2 Annual opening1 Average3 British pound 0.81400 0.83370 0.85034 US dollar 1.32620 1.37910 1.32943 (in €) 1 Source: European Central Bank, reference rate on the first day of the year. 2 Source: European Central Bank, reference rate on the last day of the year. 3 The annual average is calculated as the 12-month average of the month-end closing rates of the European Central Bank. Management has set a policy requiring Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against the functional currency. Group companies are required to hedge material balance sheet exposures via the use of foreign exchange derivatives with Group Treasury, whereby a financing company operated by Group Treasury trades these foreign exchange derivatives with external banks. As at 31 December 2013, PostNL had no net investment hedges outstanding. Significant acquisitions and local debt are usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets. As at 31 December 2013, if the euro had weakened 10% against both the British pound and the US dollar with all other variables held constant, the profit before income taxes on the foreign exchange exposure on financial instruments would have been €0 million lower (2012: 0). In 2013, the net income sensitivity to movements in euro/pound sterling and euro/US dollar exchange rates compared to 2012 did not change. Equity would have been impacted by €9 million (2012: 18), all related to the move in hedge reserve. Credit risk Credit risk represents the losses that the company would incur if counterparties with whom PostNL enters into financial transactions are unable to fulfil the terms of those agreements. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposures relating to customers. The company attempts to minimise, within its approved investment framework, its credit risk exposure by only transacting with financial institutions, ensuring established credit guidelines are met and by managing its customer portfolio. In the current economic environment, PostNL emphasises proactive management of credit risk relevant to both customers and financial institutions. Several initiatives have been proposed by Group Treasury to widen the range of instruments and to minimise the exposure to individual financial institutions and commercial organisations. On the reporting date, there was no significant concentration of credit risk across the customer portfolio. The top 10 trade accounts receivable accounted for 11% of outstanding trade receivables as at 31 December 2013. Within Italy, €21 million of the total trade accounts receivable related to Riscossione Sicilia, an Italian tax collection agency for Sicily. Management expects the receivable to be fully recoverable. Although the timing of collection is uncertain, management expects the receivable to be collected within two years. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, PostNL attempts to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available. A PostNL Annual Report 2013 123 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes downgrade in PostNL’s credit rating may negatively affect its ability to obtain funds from financial institutions and banks and increase its financing costs by increasing the interest rates on its outstanding debt or the interest rates at which the company is able to refinance existing debt or incur new debt. Furthermore, other non PostNL-specific adverse market conditions could also turn out to have a material adverse effect on the company’s funding ability. The PostNL Group has the following undrawn revolving credit facility (committed) with end term 1 June 2016: Undrawn committed credit facilities At 31 December 2013 2012 Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facilities 570 570 (in € millions) The following table analyses PostNL’s financial liabilities, categorising them into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period on the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.

A downgrade in PostNL’s credit rating may negatively affect its ability to obtain funds from financial institutions, retail investors and banks and increase its financing costs by increasing the interest rates of its outstanding debt or the interest rates at which the company is able to refinance existing debt or incur new debt. This could affect PostNL’s returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The terms and conditions of PostNL’s material long-term and short-term debts, as well as its material drawn or undrawn committed credit facilities do not include any financial covenants. There are no obligations to accelerate repayments of these material debts and committed facilities in the event of a credit rating downgrade. The debt and credit facility instruments vary on a case-by-case basis and mostly contain customary clauses as are generally observed in the market, such as negative pledge conditions, restrictions on the sale/the use of the proceeds of the sale of assets or businesses and, in most cases, change of control clauses. 124 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes 31 Financial instruments (No corresponding financial statement number) Summary financial instruments In line with IAS 39 and IFRS 13, the following categories of financial assets and financial liabilities can be distinguished.

PostNL uses commonly-practised fair value valuation methods for its derivatives. The valuations represent a best approximation of the trading value of these derivatives at their valuation moment. The derivatives within the financial instruments are thereby grouped within level two of the fair value measurement hierarchy. The credit risk adjustments (counterparty or own) are made in accordance with IFRS 13. Eurobonds On 17 December 2013, PostNL completed the partial repurchase of the outstanding eurobonds. To fund the bond buy-back transaction, PostNL used proceeds received from the sale of 15% of the shareholding in TNT Express. The outstanding nominals of the eurobonds of PostNL in issue as at 31 December 2013 are listed in the table below: Outstanding eurobonds (nominal values) Issue currency Nominal value at Bond buy-back Nominal value at 31 Dec 2012 during 2013 31 Dec 2013 3.875% eurobond 2015 EUR 400 (51) 349 5.375% eurobond 2017 EUR 640 (132) 508 7.500% eurobond 2018 GBP 450 (136) 314 (in millions) As at 31 December 2013 all the outstanding eurobonds are measured at amortised cost of €1,224 million (2012: 1,575). This represents the outstanding nominal value, corrected for the costs of issuance under par (‘at a discount’) that are still to be amortised. The book value is equal to the amortised cost value. The foreign exchange exposure on the £314 million eurobond is hedged via the £225/€284 million and the £88/€111 million cross-currency swaps (see ‘Derivatives’). PostNL Annual Report 2013 125 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes For the outstanding eurobonds, see the table below.

Financial leases Total debt on financial leases mainly consists of financial lease contracts on plant and equipment. For the total outstanding financial leases, see the following table. Outstanding financial leases At 31 December Nominal Fixed/floating Hedge Carrying Fair value value interest accounting value Total outstanding financial leases 2013 2 fixed No 2 2 Total outstanding financial leases 2012 3 fixed No 3 3 (in € millions) Derivatives Cross-currency swaps As a result of the bond-buy back transaction (see ‘Eurobonds’), one of two £225/€284 million cross-currency swaps originally entered into to hedge a £450 million eurobond has been adjusted to comply with Group policy on managing currency risk (see note 30 for more details on Financial Risk Management). The adjustment was performed via an accelerated settlement of £136 million out of the originally swapped amount of £225 million. The net cash impact of the accelerated settlement was -€18 million. As at 31 December 2013, PostNL had £225/€284 million and £88/€111 million cross-currency swaps to hedge the £314 million eurobond and a £13/€16 million cross-currency swap to hedge foreign exchange exposure on the £13 million loan provided to a Group company. These swaps act as the hedge on the cash flow currency risk. Since all prior forward starting swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges, the market value movements of the effective portion of the hedges were included in equity at the moment these swaps were unwound. These market value movements will remain in the hedge reserve and will be straight-line amortised to the income statement until 2015. In 2013, net financial expense included an amortisation of €2 million from the hedge reserve. In 2013, the total ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises from the use of fair value hedges amounted to €0 million (2012: 0). The total ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises from the use of cash flow hedges amounted to €2 million (2012: 0). The inefficiency was caused by credit valuation adjustments of -€2 million (2012: 0) to the fair value of outstanding cross-currency swaps to comply with IFRS 13 provisions. The net result on the financial statements of PostNL was therefore €0 million (2012: 0). For the outstanding cross-currency swaps, see the table below. Outstanding swaps At 31 december Nominal Forward Currency Outstanding Pay Receive Hedge Fair value Starting value Total cross-currency swaps 2013 411 No GBP/EUR Yes float fixed cash flow 35 Total cross-currency swaps 2012 584 No GBP/EUR Yes float fixed cash flow 29 (in € millions) 126 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes The fair value of the outstanding long-term cross-currency swaps is recorded as a long-term asset in ‘financial fixed assets’ or as a liability in ‘long-term debt’ and includes credit valuation adjustments made to comply with IFRS 13. The value of the sterling/euro cross-currency swaps mainly relates to movements in the sterling/euro exchange rate and offsets the movement in the carrying value of the £314 million eurobond and £13 million intercompany loan. However, credit valuation adjustments to comply with IFRS 13 do not relate to the sterling/euro exchange rate. Such valuation adjustments will represent the ‘ineffective’ part of the hedge relationship and will be offset by the movement between hedge reserve and income statement to record the ineffective part of the hedge relationship. Foreign currency exchange contracts PostNL has entered into short-term foreign currency exchange derivatives to hedge foreign exchange fair value and cash flow risks. The fair value of these outstanding foreign exchange hedges is recorded as a current asset in ‘prepayments and accrued income’ or as a current liability in ‘total current borrowings’ and includes credit valuation adjustments made to comply with IFRS 13. The foreign exchange results on the outstanding fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement and offset the foreign exchange results of the underlying balance sheet items. Credit valuation adjustments for the purpose of IFRS 13 will represent the ‘ineffective’ part of the hedge relationship and will impact the income statement. The IFRS 13 credit valuation adjustments for foreign exchange contracts made in 2013 amounted to €0 million (2012: 0). The cash flow hedges on highly probable transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve within equity on the effective portion of the forward exchange contracts as at 31 December 2013 amounted to €0 million (2012: 0). These reserves are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the income statement. The IFRS 13 credit valuation adjustments for such cash flow hedges will represent the ‘ineffective’ part of the hedge relationship and will be offset by the movement between hedge reserve and income statement to record the ineffective part of the hedge relationship. The IFRS 13 credit valuation adjustments for foreign exchange contracts made in 2013 amounted to €0 million (2012: 0). For the outstanding foreign exchange contracts, see the table below.

For calculating diluted earnings per share, an average number of 440,867,038 is taken into account. For both calculations, the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent of -€170 million (2012: 656) has been applied. At 31 December 2013, PostNL had potential obligations under share plans to deliver 893,741 shares (2012: 0), calculated based on the share price of €4.15 as at 31 December 2013.

PostNL’s most signiﬁcant joint venture as at 31 December 2013 was the 50% interest in Postkantoren B.V. with ING Bank N.V., to operate post offices in the Netherlands. In addition, PostNL holds a 50% interest in HIM Holtzbrinck joint ventures. The company's share in the joint ventures' off-balance sheet commitments amounted to €24 million and mainly related to rent and operating lease contracts of €18 million, guarantees issued of €1 million and other commitments of €5 million. Key pro rata information regarding all joint ventures in which PostNL has joint decisive inﬂuence over operations is presented in the following table and includes balances at 50%.

In some cases, there are contractual arrangements in place under which PostNL companies source supplies from such undertakings, or such undertakings source supplies from PostNL. During 2013, purchases of PostNL from its joint ventures amounted to €12 million (2012: 22). No sales were made by PostNL companies to its joint ventures (2012: 0). The net amounts due to the joint venture entities amounted to €0 million (2012: 14). As at 31 December 2013, no material amounts were payable by PostNL to associated companies. Related party transactions with PostNL’s pension fund are presented in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. PostNL considers the members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board as key management personnel as defined by IAS 24. For disclosure on related party transactions with the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Relationship agreement PostNL and TNT Express Following the demerger of Express, PostNL and TNT Express entered into a relationship agreement and a separation agreement. The relationship agreement provides for the terms and conditions on lock-up and orderly market arrangements, subject to which PostNL may reduce its shareholding in TNT Express over time, and includes certain arrangements with respect to corporate governance of TNT Express. On 24 February 2013, the relationship agreement was updated and amended. Based 128 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes on the amendments, PostNL recommended Mr Sjoerd Vollebregt for appointment to the Supervisory Board of TNT Express. Mr Vollebregt was appointed a member of the Supervisory Board of TNT Express on 10 April 2013. Furthermore, the new agreement included a relaxation of certain conditions and restrictions as imposed under the previous relationship agreement. The voting restrictions that previously applied to PostNL in relation to significant changes in the identity and character of TNT Express were lifted. Further amendments have been made in favour of PostNL in respect of possible future divestments of its shareholding, or parts of the shareholding, in TNT Express. The separation agreement creates certain rights and obligations for both PostNL and TNT Express after the demerger. These relate to aspects including: (i) the unwinding of financial relationships, such as cash pools, guarantees, existing financing relationships with third parties, rights and obligations resulting in joint liabilities and other intercompany arrangements; (ii) their employees, such as allocation, works councils, collective labour agreements, share-based schemes and pensions; (iii) tax, such as the cut-off of the existing fiscal unity, profit and loss pooling arrangements; (iv) accounting and treasury, such as changes in interim period, opening balance-related matters and credit rating; and (v) litigation, such as claim and litigation handling, non-allocated and non-anticipated claims and release of provisions. Pursuant to the pension arrangements concluded between PostNL, TNT Express and the pension funds, PostNL provided a subsidiary guarantee for TNT Express in the event of violation of contractual terms, irregularity of payments and bankruptcy. This subsidiary guarantee only relates to pension benefits accrued under the existing pension plans (up to the date of the demerger) and will comprise a liability that gradually decreases over time. In addition, PostNL has provided a guarantee for future TNT Express pension payments, barring certain unforeseen circumstances. The guarantees of PostNL will only exist as long as the coverage ratio of the funds are below a certain level. If the coverage ratio rises above that level and remains above that level for three consecutive quarters, the guarantees lapse. As at 31 December 2013, no events had occurred that triggered disclosure of a significant contingent asset or liability following the aforementioned agreements with TNT Express. PostNL Annual Report 2013 129 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes 35 Segment information (No corresponding financial statement number) PostNL identifies the following reportable segments: • Mail in the Netherlands, which provides mail services in the Netherlands, including the provision of the universal service and data and electronic communications activities, • Parcels, which provides standard parcel services in the Netherlands and Belgium for both domestic and cross-border parcel distribution, and • International, which provides addressed and unaddressed mail activities outside the Netherlands, in particular the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. The measure of profit and loss and assets and liabilities is based on the PostNL Group accounting policies, which are compliant with IFRS. The pricing of intercompany sales is done at arm’s length.

As a result, this information is not presented as part of the reportable segments. The key financial performance indicator for management of the reportable segments is underlying cash operating income. The underlying cash operating performance focuses on the underlying cash earnings performance, which is the basis for the dividend policy. In the analysis of the underlying cash operating performance, adjustments are made for non-recurring and exceptional items as well as adjustments for non-cash costs for pensions and provisions. For pensions, the IFRS-based defined benefit plan pension expenses are replaced by the non-IFRS measure of the actual cash contributions for such plans. For the other provisions, the IFRS-based net charges are replaced by the related cash outflows. Underlying cash operating income is reported on a monthly basis to the chief operating decision-makers.

This Act requires a designated postal provider to provide the Universal Postal Service in the Netherlands. By separate decree, PostNL has been designated provider of the Universal Postal Service. The Dutch Postal Act 2009 sets the requirements for the Universal Postal Service. The Authority for Consumers & Markets (ACM) supervises the postal market and PostNL’s performance of the Universal Postal Service. The responsibility for postal policy falls under the authority of the Minister of Economic Affairs. The Universal Postal Service Scope The domestic Universal Postal Service consists of the conveyance against payment of standard single rates of: • all items of correspondence with a maximum individual weight of two kilogrammes, • postal parcels with a maximum individual weight of 10 kilogrammes, and • registered, registered insured and registered value declared items. The Dutch Postal Act 2009 does not require PostNL to offer domestic services for the delivery of bulk parcels, bulk mail or unaddressed mail items. International outbound bulk mail and parcels are also part of the Universal Postal Service. For international inbound and outbound mail, the rules of the UPU apply to PostNL. Regulatory conditions for the provision of the Universal Postal Service The Dutch Postal Act 2009 requires PostNL to provide nationwide services and to perform a delivery round five days a week, delivering on average no less than 95% of all standard single-rated domestic letters posted the day before, except on Sundays, public holidays and, as of 1 January 2014, Mondays. Urgent medical items and funeral cards are still delivered on Mondays. PostNL is required to maintain a network of service points for access by the general public. The amended Postal 132 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes Regulation 2009, effective as of 29 January 2014, covers detailed tariff regulation, cost and revenue accounting, financial administration and reporting. Accounting and other financial obligations PostNL’s reporting obligations include a system for allocating costs and revenues to the Universal Postal Service. A financial report on the annual performance of the Universal Postal Service must be submitted to ACM, accompanied by an independent auditor’s opinion, to certify that PostNL’s financial accounting system complies with these obligations and is applied properly. Modernisation of the Universal Postal Service In June 2013, the Minister of Economic Affairs sent a letter to parliament recognising the need for further modernisation of the Universal Service Obligation. The minister stated that continuing volume declines demand substantial changes to both tariffs and obligations in order to keep Universal Postal Services accessible and affordable to all. He intends to mitigate the requirements for mandatory letter boxes and service outlets. As a result, coming years could see the number of letter boxes being reduced from 19,000 to 8,700, and service outlets from 2,000 to 1,000. The minister will send parliament a proposed amendment to the Postal Act 2009 in the summer of 2014. Tariffs and tariff regulation The Minister of Economic Affairs approved additional tariff increases for 2013 and 2014. PostNL therefore increased USO tariffs as of 1 January 2013, 1 August 2013 and 1 January 2014. As of 29 January 2014, tariff regulation has been adjusted. The price cap, meant to limit the return on sales (RoS) to 10%, applies to USO letters and parcels together. For these purposes, ACM first has to define a fictional permitted average postal rate. Second, the ACM annually has to define additional tariff headroom, taking into account the development of the general Consumer Price Index, the development of USO volumes and, occasionally, an earlier exceeding of the RoS limit. Following each ACM adjustment, PostNL is allowed to set rates. Net costs PostNL has withdrawn its net cost application over 2011 and has not filed an application over 2012, now that the Minister of Economic Affairs has sent his proposal to increase the financial stability of the Universal Postal Service to parliament. Significant market power Parliament has voted in favour of the amended Dutch Postal Act 2009 introducing a supervisory regime of significant market power. As of 1 January 2014, the ACM is authorised to impose specific obligations on parties with significant market power. Before it can impose obligations, ACM has to establish significant market power and assess a suitable obligation for the type of potential competition problem that may need to be resolved. PostNL expects the results of the analysis by the ACM in the second half of 2014. Social Agreement Programme to combat pseudo self-employment The Minister of Social Affairs and Employment initiated a national programme to combat pseudo self-employment in 2013. The Minister aims to improve the legal position of people working in different sectors as an independent contractor. The Parcels subcontractors of PostNL and its competitors fall within the scope of this programme. Participation Act The Social Agreement includes the Participation Act, an approach to help people with an occupational disability to find work. Employers are expected to actively participate and to find work for 5,000 people with an occupational disability in 2014. In 2026, Dutch employers are expected to offer work to 100,000 people with an occupational disability. The Dutch Second Chamber of Parliament has voted in favour of the proposed Participation Act on 20 February 2014. The proposed Participation Act will now be sent to the First Chamber of Parliament. Value added tax on postal services PostNL is not allowed to charge value added tax on postal items that form part of the Universal Postal Service. Consequently, we cannot deduct VAT amounts paid to purchase services and goods related to the Universal Postal Service. For all other postal services, PostNL is required to charge VAT, similar to our competitors.

PostNL Annual Report 2013 137 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the corporate financial statements General information and description of the business PostNL N.V. (hereafter referred to as ‘the company’) is a public limited liability company with its registered seat and head office at Prinses Beatrixlaan 23, 2595 AK, 's-Gravenhage, the Netherlands. The company’s principal activity is acting as a holding company for the Group companies of the PostNL Group (‘the Group’) that provide businesses and consumers in the Benelux, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy with an extensive range of services for their mail needs. The company is the ultimate parent company of the Group. The corporate financial statements were authorised for issue by PostNL’s Board of Management and Supervisory Board on 24 February 2014 and are subject to adoption at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 16 April 2014. Reclassification and partial sale of the stake in TNT Express In January 2013, UPS withdrew its offer for TNT Express that was announced in March 2012. Accordingly, the stake in TNT Express no longer met the criteria under IFRS 5 to be classified as an asset held for sale, and was therefore accounted for as investment in associates measured at cost. Following the withdrawal of the UPS offer in January 2013, the share price of TNT Express declined from €8.43 on 31 December 2012 to €6.85 on 27 September 2013. On 6 December 2013, PostNL sold part of its stake in TNT Express at a price of €6.20 per share, resulting in gross cash proceeds of €507 million and a book profit of €141 million. The partial disposal consisted of a private placement to institutional investors of 81,743,614 TNT Express ordinary shares (15% of the outstanding share capital of TNT Express). The remaining stake comprises 80,386,421 TNT Express ordinary shares, equivalent to 14.8% of the outstanding share capital of TNT Express. In accordance with IAS 39, the 14.8% stake in TNT Express is considered an available-for-sale financial asset measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value recognised in other comprehensive income. The fair value as at 31 December 2013 amounts to €542 million and has been determined by multiplying the closing share price on 31 December 2013 of €6.75 by 80,386,421, the total number of issued ordinary shares held by PostNL. Summary of significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these corporate financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. All amounts included in the financial statements are presented in euros, unless stated otherwise. Basis of preparation The corporate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and Dutch law. IFRS-EU includes the application of International Accounting Standards (IAS), related interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and interpretations of the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC), issued and effective, or issued and adopted early, as at 31 December 2013. Basis of measurement In the corporate financial statements, the same accounting principles have been applied as set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, except for the valuation of the investments as presented under financial fixed assets in the corporate financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented. In the corporate financial statements, the investments are recorded at cost less impairments, whereas for the PostNL investments the deemed cost approach under IFRS 1 has been applied. In the corporate statement of income, dividend received from investments is recorded as dividend income. Due to this application, the corporate equity and net result are not equal to the consolidated equity and net result. A reconciliation for total shareholders’ equity and total comprehensive income is presented in note 42 to the corporate financial statements. Changes in accounting policies and disclosures a) New and amended standards adopted by the company A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2013, and have been applied in preparing these corporate financial statements. We refer to the descriptions included in the ‘Summary of significant accounting policies' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The company has assessed the impact on the corporate financial statements. Except for the impact of the revised IAS 19, none of 138 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate financial statements these had a significant effect on the corporate financial statements. The impact of the revised IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' on the corporate financial statements differs from the impact on the consolidated financial statements due to local plans. Summary of restatements The effect on the year-end 2011 corporate balance sheet of the adoption of IAS19R is as follows: • the reported pension assets of €1,200 million decreased by €654 million to a restated pension asset of €546 million, • the reported deferred tax liability of €299 million decreased by €163 million to a restated deferred tax liability of €136 million, and • the reported equity of €1,918 million decreased by €491 million to a restated equity of €1,427 million. The following table summarises the effect on the 2012 corporate balance sheet and corporate (comprehensive) income statement of the adoption of IAS19R.

These have not been applied in preparing these corporate financial statements. We refer to the descriptions included in the ‘Summary of significant accounting policies' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The company has assessed the impact on the corporate financial statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the corporate financial statements. PostNL Annual Report 2013 139 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate financial statements Functional and presentation currency The corporate financial statements are presented in euros, the company’s functional currency. All information presented in euros has been rounded to the nearest million. Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of the corporate financial statements in conformity with IFRS-EU requires management to exercise judgements and make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the company's accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the corporate financial statements are disclosed in the note ‘Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying PostNL’s accounting policies' to the consolidated financial statements. Key accounting estimates and judgements affecting the assessment and measurement of impairment are included in note 38 to the corporate financial statements. Investments in subsidiaries and associated companies Investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are stated at cost, less impairment. Dividend income from the company’s subsidiaries and associated companies is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Impairment of investments in subsidiaries At each balance sheet date, the company reviews whether there is an indication that its investments in subsidiaries are impaired. An indication for impairment of the investments in subsidiaries may include management’s downward adjustment of the strategic plan. Further indications for impairments of its investments may include other areas where observable data indicates a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows. These determinations require significant judgement. In making this judgement, management evaluates, among other factors, the financial performance of and business outlook for its investments, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow. If any indication for impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the investments is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. An investment is impaired if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an investment’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The investments’ fair value less costs of disposal represents the best estimate of the amount the company would receive if it sold its investments. The fair value of each investment has been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows, taking into account costs of disposal, except for the investment in associates for which the estimated fair value has been based on external market information. The determination of the investment’s value in use is based on calculations using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a nine-year period. Cash flows beyond the nine-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates. If the recoverable amount of an investment is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to its recoverable amount. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of income. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates or external market information used to determine the investment’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories above. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair 140 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate financial statements value. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity. When available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as a gain or a loss. Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based compensation plans As of 2013, PostNL operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for (conditional) shares of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense. Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of (conditional) shares that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. In addition, for some share-based compensation plans, employees provide services in advance of the grant date. Therefore, the grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement period and grant date. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The grant by the company of shares to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity accounts. Cash-settled share-based compensation plans PostNL operates a number of cash-settled share-based compensation plans. They involve a cash payment to employees for amounts that are based on the price of PostNL’s shares and which is equal to the gain that would have been made by exercising the notional options and immediately selling the shares in the market. The corresponding liability for the cashsettled plans is measured, initially and at each reporting date until settled, at the fair value of the rights, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted and the extent to which the employees have rendered service to date. Any changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of rights that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, PostNL revises its estimates of the number of rights that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to liabilities. Provisions for pension liabilities The net defined benefit liability/asset for all pension and other post-employment plans that qualify as defined benefit plans is determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value of the plan assets. The resulting deficit or surplus is adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling and for any effect of minimum funding requirements. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Minimum funding requirements might affect the availability of reductions in future contributions or might give rise to a liability if the required contributions will not be available to PostNL once they have been paid. PostNL uses actuarial calculations (projected unit credit method) to measure the obligations and the costs. For the calculations, actuarial assumptions are made about financial variables (such as the discount rate) and demographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality). The discount rate is determined by reference to market rates using high-quality corporate bonds. Service costs are recognised as operating expenses in the income statement. Gains or losses on the amendment or curtailment of a defined benefit plan (past service costs) and gains or losses on settlement are all recognised as operating expenses in the income statement on the date of the amendment, curtailment or settlement. The net interest expense/income on the net defined benefit liability/asset is recognised as ‘Interest and similar expenses/ income’ in the income statement (below operating income). Deviations between the expected and actual development of the pension obligation and plan assets, resulting in actuarial gains and losses, are immediately recognised within Other Comprehensive Income (net of tax). The impact of the asset ceiling and/or minimum funding requirements is also recognised within Other Comprehensive Income (net of tax). PostNL Annual Report 2013 141 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate financial statements Pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or due. Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the corporate financial statements, in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholders. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs of disposal. Assets held for sale are no longer amortised or depreciated from the time they are classified as such. Taxation The company is tax-resident in the Netherlands. The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The amount of income tax included in the statement of income is determined in accordance with the rules established by the tax authorities in the Netherlands, based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable. Deferred tax assets and/or liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities are calculated using the substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that they will be realised. 142 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the corporate statement of financial position 38 Total financial fixed assets Total financial fixed assets: 3,626 million (2012: 2,442) The movement in investments is as follows: Statement of changes corporate financial fixed assets Investments Investments Available-for-sale Total in Mail in associates financial assets Balance at 31 December 2011 2,442 860 3,302 Transfer to assets held for sale (860) (860) Balance at 31 December 2012 2,442 0 0 2,442 Additions to capital 4 4 Reversal impairment Mail investments 638 Transfer from assets held for sale 860 0 Disposal of 15% shareholding in TNT Express (507) (507) Book gain on disposal 145 145 Transfer to available-for-sale financial assets (498) 498 0 Change in value available-for-sale financial assets 44 44 Total changes 642 0 542 (314) Balance at 31 December 2013 3,084 0 542 3,626 (in € millions) Investments in Mail The subsidiary undertakings of the company as at 31 December 2013, and the company’s percentage interest, are set out below. Breakdown corporate investments Name of direct subsidiairy Country of Ownership % incorporation PostNL Holdco B.V. Netherlands 100% PostNL Holding B.V. Netherlands 100% A complete list of investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and jointly-controlled entities will be attached to the company’s annual report made available to the Chamber of Commerce. Following the (financial) achievements in 2013 on regulatory developments, cost savings and the pension agreements, a detailed review has been performed of the recoverability of the Mail investments. The recoverable value of each investment is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. The recoverable value is determined based on the value in use as this was higher than the fair value less costs of disposal at year end 2013. The value in use has been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows. For all investments, the estimated future cash flows are based on a nineyear forecast and business plans, as management considers these forecasts reliable based on past experience. Uncertainties relating to volume decline, pension top-up payments and efficiency measures are taken into account. Fair value less costs of disposal represents the best estimate of the amount PostNL would receive if it sold the investment. The estimated future cash flows are derived from the most recent strategic planning approved by management. The applied growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rates on the related operation and market. The company has determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rates in the investments' valuations vary from 11% to 13% (pre-tax). Key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values for the investments of the company are the following: • maturity of the underlying market, market share and volume development in order to determine the revenue mix and growth rate, • level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development, taking into account the nature of the underlying costs and potential economies of scale, • level of capital expenditure in network-related assets, and • discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and inflation-related risks. PostNL Annual Report 2013 143 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate statement of financial position The detailed review of the value of the Mail investments resulted in the recoverable value of the Mail investments exceeding their carrying value by €638 million. The recoverable value was derived from the 2013 strategic planning, taking into account uncertainties relating to volume decline, pension top-up payments and efficiency measures. Management concluded that a reversal of the 2011 impairment was present for an amount of €638 million (2012: no impairment or reversal). In 2013, the additions to capital of €4 million represented the company's compensation for equity-settled share-based payments to the investments' employees. As the company grants its shares directly to its investments' employees without charging its investments, the company recognised, in line with IFRS, the increase in the investments as a capital contribution. Investments in associates Following the withdrawal of the UPS offer in January 2013, the stake in TNT Express of €860 million was transferred back from assets classified as held for sale to investments in associates measured at cost. On 6 December 2013, PostNL sold part of its stake in TNT Express at a price of €6.20 per share, resulting in gross cash proceeds of €507 million. The partial disposal consisted of a private placement to institutional investors of 81,743,614 TNT Express ordinary shares (15% of the outstanding share capital of TNT Express). Following the disposal, the remaining 14.8% stake in TNT Express with a carrying value of €498 million (corresponding to a share price of €6.20) was transferred to available-for-sale financial assets. The sales transaction resulted in a book profit of €141 million. The book profit on the total stake of 162,130,035 shares mainly consisted of the difference of €145 million between the carrying value of €860 million based on a share price of €5.30 and the value of €1,005 million based on the selling price of €6.20 per share. The remaining loss resulted from incurred expenses of €4 million. In the income statement, the book profit of €141 million has been included as 'book profit on disposal of investment in associates'. Available-for-sale financial assets Following the sale of 15% of the shareholding in TNT Express on 6 December 2013, the remaining 14.8% stake in TNT Express was transferred from investments in associates to available-for-sale financial assets for an amount of €498 million (see above). In accordance with IAS 39, the 14.8% stake in TNT Express is considered an available-for-sale financial asset measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value recognised in other comprehensive income. The fair value as at 31 December 2013 amounts to €542 million and has been determined by multiplying the closing share price on 31 December 2013 of €6.75 by the total number of issued ordinary shares held by PostNL of 80,386,421. The gain of €44 million has been recorded in other comprehensive income. 39 Loan receivable from/eurobonds held by Group companies Loan receivable from Group companies: 400 million (2012: 0)/eurobonds held by Group companies: 400 million (2012: 0) The loan receivable from Group companies of €400 million and the eurobonds held by Group companies of €400 million relate to balances with G3 Worldwide Mail N.V. and are a result of the bond buy-back transaction that was executed by G3 Worldwide Mail N.V. 40 Accounts receivable from/payable to Group companies Accounts receivable from Group companies: 2 million (2012: 1)/Accounts payable to Group companies: 226 million (2012: 443) Accounts receivable from Group companies related to a receivable from PostNL Holding B.V. of €2 million (2012: 1). Accounts payable to Group companies related to an amount payable to PostNL Finance B.V. of €226 million (2012: 443). The fair value of the accounts receivable from and payable to Group companies approximated the carrying value, due to the short-term nature. There are no balances as at 31 December 2013 that are expected to be settled after 12 months (2012: 0). 144 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate statement of financial position 41 Assets classified as held for sale Assets classified as held for sale: 0 million (2012: 860) In January 2013, UPS withdrew its offer for TNT Express that was announced in March 2012. Accordingly, the stake in TNT Express no longer met the criteria under IFRS 5 to be classified as an asset held for sale. It was therefore transferred to investments in associates. 42 Equity Equity: 1,925 million (2012: 1,138) Equity consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the company of €1,925 million (2012: 1,138). For the disclosure on issued share capital, additional paid-in capital, the hedge reserve and the reserve relating to available-for-sale financial assets, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. The 2013 tax impact on the cash flow hedges is €5 million (2012: 4). The hedge reserve and the reserve relating to available-for-sale financial assets are legal reserves and are restricted for distribution. As at 31 December 2013, the revaluation reserve of €2,187 million (2012: 1,549) related to the applied deemed cost approach for the investments in Mail as of 1 January 2010, partly offset by the net recorded impairment charges of €395 million. The revaluation reserve is a legal reserve and is restricted for distribution. During 2013, the other reserves decreased to -€1,409 million from -€905 million, due to a negative pension effect within other comprehensive income (net of tax) of €195 million and a reclassification to the revaluation reserve of €638 million, partly offset by the appropriation of net income for 2012 of €325 million and share based payments of €4 million. As at 31 December 2013, the unappropriated profit amounted to €935 million (2012: 325). The differences between total shareholders’ equity and total comprehensive income according to the IFRS-EU consolidated financial statements and the corporate financial statements under IFRS-EU as at and for the year ended 31 December 2013 is as follows: Consolidated to corporate equity and total comprehensive income attributable to the equity holders of the parent Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Equity Income Equity Income Consolidated Equity and total comprehensive income-reported (679) (381) 1,069 672 Effect of adoption IAS 19R (1,370) (680) Equity and total comprehensive income-restated (679) (381) (301) (8) Reconciliation items Reconciliation items previous years 1,439 1,518 Effect adoption IAS 19R on investments Mail 202 3 Reversal impairment Mail 638 638 (Reversal)/impairment of TNT Express 263 263 (448) (448) Difference in book profit sale 15% of TNT Express 247 247 Results from investments (43) (43) 160 160 Other comprehensive income (CTA/hedges/associates/pensions) 59 59 4 4 Other direct equity movements 1 3 Total reconciliation items 2,604 1,164 1,439 (281) Corporate Shareholders' equity and total comprehensive income-reported 1,925 783 2,306 388 Effect of adoption IAS 19R (1,168) (677) Shareholders' equity and total comprehensive income-restated 1,925 783 1,138 (289) (in € millions) The reconciling items for equity and income are further detailed below. Reconciliation items The 2012 reconciliation items previous years of €1,518 million relate to the difference between the reported consolidated equity as at 31 December 2011 of €400 million and the reported corporate equity of €1,918 million. PostNL Annual Report 2013 145 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate statement of financial position The effect of the adoption of IAS 19R on the investments in Mail of €202 million can be calculated as the effect on corporate equity as at 31 December 2012 of -€1,168 million minus the effect on consolidated equity of -€1,370 million. The effect on the result for 2012 of €3 million relates to the difference between the effect on the corporate result of -€677 million and the effect on the consolidated result of -€680 million. For details of the reversal of the impairment of the Mail investments recognised in the corporate financial statements, see note 38 to the corporate financial statements. For details of the impact of the (reversal)/impairments of the investment in TNT Express recognised in the 2013 and 2012 consolidated financial statements, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. As regards the difference in book profit on the disposal of 15% of the shares in TNT Express, €250 million of this was caused by the difference in carrying value at the moment of the sale, which was €1,110 million in the consolidated accounts and €860 million in the corporate accounts. The remaining €3 million is caused by the positive effect of the recycling of other comprehensive income of the associate TNT Express in the consolidated accounts. Reconciliation item Results from investments The 2013 results from investments are €43 million lower in the corporate financial statements as dividend income for 2013 was €124 million, whereas the result in the consolidated financial statements was €167 million. The result from investments of €167 million can be calculated from the result from the consolidated income statement of -€170 million, plus the impairment of TNT Express of €263 million, plus the book loss on the disposal of 15% of the shares of TNT Express of €106 million, minus the result from the corporate income statement of €935 million excluding the dividend income of €124 million, the reversal of the impairment of the Mail investments of €638 million and the book profit on the disposal of 15% of the shares of TNT Express of €141 million. The 2012 results from investments were €160 million higher in the corporate financial statements as dividend income for 2012 was €275 million, whereas the result in the consolidated financial statement was €115 million. The result from investments of €115 million can be calculated from the result from the reported consolidated income statement of €677 million, minus the reversal of the impairment of TNT Express of €448 million, minus the result from the reported corporate income statement of €389 million excluding the dividend income of €275 million. Reconciliation item Other comprehensive income The reconciliation item ‘Other comprehensive income' represents hedge and currency translation adjustments and adjustments for actuarial gains/(losses) which were recognised in the consolidated financial statements but not in the corporate financial statements as the investments are stated at cost. It also represents other comprehensive income from the investments in associates (stake in TNT Express) that was recognised in the consolidated financial statements but not in the corporate financial statements. The 2013 difference in other comprehensive income of €59 million included -€35 million of actuarial losses on pensions and -€24 million of other comprehensive income related to the stake in TNT Express. The 2012 difference in other comprehensive income of €4 million included -€5 million of reported other comprehensive income related to the stake in TNT Express and €1 million of currency translation adjustments related to movements in exchange rate differences on converting foreign subsidiaries. Reconciliation item Other direct equity movements In 2013, the additional difference in direct equity movements of €1 million related to the buy-out of the minority interest in Spring Global Mail. In 2012, the additional difference in direct equity movements of €3 million concerned an amount of -€2 million related to the buy-out of minority interests in subsidiaries of TNT Post UK and -€1 million related to various other items. 43 Pension assets / Provisions for pension liabilities Pension assets: 0 million (2012: 0) and provisions for pension liabilities: 172 million (2012: 104) The company is the sponsoring employer of two Dutch pension plans, which are externally funded in two separate pension funds and cover the majority of PostNL’s employees in the Netherlands. In accordance with IAS 19R.41, PostNL, as the sponsoring employer for two Dutch pension plans, recognises the net defined benefit cost in the corporate financial statements of the company. The relevant Group companies recognise the costs equal to the contributions payable for the period in their financial statements. In its corporate financial statements, PostNL 146 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate statement of financial position recognises the contributions received from the relevant Group companies as a benefit that offsets the defined benefit pension expense. For the company, the contributions received from the relevant Group companies more than offset the pension expense. The impact of the contributions is represented as participant contributions in the following table. As a result, the corporate financial statements record a defined benefit pension income of €195 million (2012: 168), whereas the consolidated financial statements record defined benefit pension expenses of €6 million (2012: 72). The following table reconciles the opening and closing balances of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, the funded status and the employer pension income for the sponsored pension plans of the company.

PostNL Annual Report 2013 147 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate statement of financial position 45 Other current liabilities Other current liabilities: 97 million (2012: 59) Other current liabilities At 31 December 2013 2012 Current interest bearing debt 6 1 Income tax payable 50 11 Interest payable 33 42 Other 8 5 Total 97 59 (in € millions) Income tax payable increased from €11 million in 2012 to €50 million in 2013 due to refunds on preliminary tax assessments relating to timing differences and internal settlements with Group companies within the PostNL fiscal unity. 148 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the corporate income statement 46 Dividend income Dividend income: 124 million (2012: 275) Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. The dividend income from the company’s subsidiaries for 2013 was €116 million (2012: 274) and the dividend income from the stake in TNT Express for 2013 was €8 million (2012: 1). 47 Reversal impairment Mail investments Reversal impairment Mail investments: 638 million (2012: 0) In 2013, an amount of €638 million in impairments on the company’s investments in Mail was reversed (2012: 0). Reference is made to note 38 to the corporate financial statements. 48 Salaries, pensions and social security contributions Salaries, pensions and social security contributions: 193 million positive (2012: 138 positive) In accordance with IAS 19R.41, the net defined benefit cost for the company’s pension plans shall be recognised in the corporate financial statements. For PostNL, the contributions charged to other Group companies more than offset the pension expense incurred, resulting in a positive amount of salaries, pensions and social security contributions over the year. For further information on defined benefit pension costs,see note 43 to the corporate financial statements. PostNL N.V. does not have any employees other than the Board of Management. 49 Net financial expense Net financial expense: 156 million (2012: 75) PostNL has financing relationships with both external banks and with PostNL companies, mainly with PostNL Finance B.V. As a result, PostNL records both external interest income and expenses from financial institutions and from PostNL Finance B.V. Interest and similar expenses Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Interest expenses (148) (102) Interest on net defined benefit pension liabilities (3) Hedge reserve recycled to profit and loss (12) (2) Total (163) (104) (in € millions) In 2013, interest expenses amounted to €148 million (2012: 102) and consisted of external interest and similar expenses of €146 million (2012: 100) and internal interest and similar expenses of €2 million (2012: 2). The external interest and similar expenses mainly related to interest expenses on long-term borrowings of €96 million (2012: 99) and the difference between nominal value and market value of bonds purchased on the date of the bond buy-back transaction of €50 million (2012: 0). Interest and similar income Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Interest income 7 3 Interest on net defined benefit pension assets 26 Total 7 29 (in € millions) In 2013, interest income amounted to €7 million (2012: 3), of which €5 million (2012: 3) related to external interest income on taxes and €2 million (2012: 0) to a fair value adjustment to reflect the own credit risk as required by IFRS 13. 50 Income taxes Income taxes: 6 million (2012: 16) In 2013, income taxes amounted to €6 million (2012: 16), or 0.6% (2012: 4.7%) of profit before income taxes of €941 million (2012: 341). PostNL Annual Report 2013 149 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate income statement Corporate effective income tax rate Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Dutch statutory income tax rate 25.0 25.0 Tax effects of: Non and partly deductible costs 0.1 Non taxable impairment reversal (17.0) Exempt income (7.0) (20.3) Other (0.5) Effective income tax rate 0.6 4.7 (in percentages) Income taxes differ from the amount calculated by multiplying the Dutch statutory corporate income tax rate by the profit before income taxes. In 2013, the effective income tax rate was 0.6% (2012: 4.7%). The statutory income tax rate in the Netherlands in 2013 was 25.0% (2012: 25.0%). In 2013, the effective income tax rate was predominantly affected by tax-exempt dividend income from the company’s investments in subsidiaries as well as a tax-exempt book profit on the divestment of the 15% shareholding in TNT Express (totalling -7.0%) and a non-taxable reversal of impairments of the Mail investments (-17.0%). Income tax expense consists of the following: Corporate income taxes Year ended at 31 December 2013 2012 Current tax expense (66) (25) Changes in deferred taxes 72 41 Total income taxes 6 16 (in € millions) In 2013, the current tax expense amounted to -€66 million (2012: -25). The difference between the total income taxes in the income statement and the current tax expense is due to timing differences. These differences are recognised as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. As at 31 December 2013, income tax payable amounted to €50 million (2012: 11). The company received income taxes, including internal settlements with Group companies within the PostNL fiscal unity, totalling €106 million (2012: 26 paid). The following table shows the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented net in the balance sheet if the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxation authority. 150 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the corporate statement of cash flows 51 Net cash from/(used in) operating activities Net cash from/(used in) operating activities: 12 million (2012: -127) Net cash from operating activities totalled €12 million in 2013 compared to -€127 million in 2012, an improvement of €139 million. The change mainly related to the change in income taxes received/(paid). Cash used in operations In 2013, the cash used in operations remained stable at -€4 million (2012: -4). Interest paid In 2013, the total cash outflow for interest paid was €90 million (2012: 97).

Report on the audit of the financial statements Our opinion In our opinion, • the consolidated financial statements as set out on pages 70 to 133 give a true and fair view of of the financial position of PostNL N.V. (the ‘company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) as at 31 December 2013, and of their results and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EUIFRSs) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. • the corporate financial statements as set out on pages 134 to 153 give a true and fair view of the financial position of PostNL N.V. as at 31 December 2013, and of its result for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRSs) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. What we have audited We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2013 of PostNL N.V., The Hague. These financial statements consist of the consolidated financial statements and the corporate financial statements. The consolidated financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013, the consolidated statement of income, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended and the notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. The corporate financial statements comprise the corporate statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013, the corporate statement of income for the year then ended, and the notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. The basis for our opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section Our Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements as included in the appendix to our report. We are independent of the company within the meaning of the relevant Dutch ethical requirements as included in the ‘Verordening op de gedragsen beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA) and the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten’ (ViO) and have fulfilled our other responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Materiality We set certain thresholds for materiality to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement we defined materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on the financial statements, would be changed or influenced. Overview of the scope of our audit Our group audit scope focused on covering the segments Mail in the Netherlands, Parcels and International (Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom) and also included audit procedures at corporate level. We determined the type of work that needed to be performed at reporting units and identified those reporting units which, in our view, required a full audit of their complete financial information, either due to their size or their risk characteristics. This, together with additional procedures performed on group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The key audit matters from our audit Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. Key audit matters are selected from the matters communicated with the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, but are not intended to represent all matters that were discussed with them. Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the key audit matters described below, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters. 154 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Other information Pension accounting As from 1 January 2013 the accounting standard for pensions has changed (IAS19R). Changes in key assumptions applied under IAS 19R have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations, pension cost incurred and equity. The accounting requires the company to make assumptions regarding parameters such as the discount rate, the rate of benefit increase and future mortality rates. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the company, whereby we also used pension experts to assist us. We tested the disclosure of the pension paragraph and specifically the change to IAS 19R. The impact of IAS 19R on the consolidated 2012 balance sheet and (comprehensive) income statement has been disclosed in the Summary of restatements in the notes. Disclosures on the assumptions applied including a sensitivity analysis are included in note 11. Stake in TNT Express Following several events in 2013 including the withdrawal of the offer by UPS and the sale of 15% of the shares of TNT Express by the company, classification and valuation of the remaining stake in TNT Express required reconsideration. We audited the classification of the remaining 14.8% stake in TNT Express as an available-for-sale financial asset and the valuation based on observable, publicly available market data, being the share price of TNT Express. Reclassification and partial sale of the stake in TNT Express including the effects on income and equity have been disclosed in the general notes and in note 3. Master Plan restructuring provision In 2013 the company announced the revision to further restructuring of its operations in the Netherlands with the Master Plan restructuring program including reductions in overhead. The measurement of the related restructuring provision highly depends on the projected cash outflows over the years affected by the estimated number of staff that will either be made redundant or apply for a mobility arrangement. Furthermore the restructuring provision depends on the progress in the Master Plans in terms of detailed plans and communication to employees. In 2013, the company further detailed the restructuring plan for overhead functions and further executed the plans in Mail operations which resulted in additions to the provision and severance payments withdrawn from the provision. In our audit we have tested the movements in the provision against supporting documentation and evaluated the assumptions used as disclosed in note 12. Impairment of goodwill and Mail investments Under IFRSs, the company is required to annually test goodwill for impairment. Furthermore, the carrying amount of the Mail related investments in the company accounts has also been tested for impairment based on impairment triggers such as the company share price and the development of the business. The impairment tests were significant to our audit because the assessment process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions, particularly those relating to the cost saving measures and price / volume developments. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the company. We used a valuation expert to assist us. The company’s conclusion on these impairment tests and disclosures about goodwill, including the assumptions used are included in note 1 and the disclosures on the partial reversal of the 2011 impairment on the Mail investments are included in note 38. Assets held for sale Following the (conditional) agreement with a co-investor for the purchase of the UK business, classification and valuation of the related assets and liabilities were reconsidered. We assessed the deal structure on the basis of the sale agreement and shareholders agreement and tested the classification and valuation of the related assets and liabilities. We challenged management on the presentation of the UK business in the 2013 financial statements and the potential impact of the transaction on future financial statements. The impact of this agreement to establish a joint venture has been disclosed in the general notes and in note 9. Our findings with respect to going concern As included in the going concern paragraph to the financial statements on page 75, the company’s financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting. The use of this basis of accounting is appropriate unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. As part of our audit of the financial statements, we concur with management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the company’s financial statements. The Board of Management has not identified a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and accordingly none is disclosed in the financial statements. Based on our audit of the financial statements, we also have not identified such a material uncertainty. However, neither management nor the auditor can guarantee the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board The respective responsibilities are set out in the appendix to this report. PostNL Annual Report 2013 155 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Other information We are required to communicate with the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We are also required to provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. Report of the Board of Management and the other information Pursuant to the legal requirements under Part 9 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code with respect to our responsibilities to report on the Board of Management and the other Information: • We have no deficiencies to report as a result of our examination whether the report of the Board of Management, to the extent we can assess, has been prepared in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and whether the other information has been annexed as required by Part 9 Book 2 of this Code; and • We report that the report of the Board of Management, to the extent we can assess, is consistent with the financial statements. Amsterdam, 24 February 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. Original has been signed by H.C. Wüst RA Appendix Responsibilities of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements The Board of Management (management) is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and for the preparation of the report of the Board of Management in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process. Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the planning and performance of the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the company and the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 156 PostNL Annual Report 2013 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Other information Extract from the articles of association on appropriation of profit Under PostNL’s current articles of association, the dividend speciﬁed in article 31, paragraph 1 will first be paid on the preference shares B if outstanding.

For CO2 reporting any changes made in the conversion factors during 2013 are not reflected in the 2012 CR performance data. Corporate responsibility performance data Unless specified otherwise, the definitions and reporting principles are unchanged from 2012. Where possible, quantitative information is compared to the corresponding figures in previous years. The reporting definitions of the CR performance data are included in this chapter or the glossary (Annex 3). CR performance data are presented in a relative way (using percentages and ratios) to enable readers to monitor and measure progress year on year, unless the reporting criteria require absolute figures to be disclosed. CO2 efficiency indicators are presented relative to the baseline year of 2007 to show progress made towards long-term objectives for CO2 efficiency improvements. Figures related to absolute CO2 emissions are all extrapolated to reflect the entire PostNL organisation, unless stated otherwise. Extrapolation is done on the basis of FTE coverage or square meters. PostNL defines coverage as the number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) working in entities that report data, divided by the total number of FTEs in the CR reporting scope. The data clarification table in Annex 2 shows the coverage per indicator.
